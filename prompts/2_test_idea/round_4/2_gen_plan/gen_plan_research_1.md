<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: RESEARCH

RESEARCH
Web research to answer key questions — like a researcher making decisions.
Runtime: LLM Agent, no code execution.
Tools: the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text).
Capabilities: Find, synthesize, and compare information across sources; survey SOTA and best practices.
Deps: REQUIRED none | OPTIONAL other RESEARCH to build on prior findings
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The research executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

  A Closure-Certified DEDUCTION SUB-MODULE for Text-to-Logic Pipelines: the TRANSFERABLE Contribution is Exact-Table Multi-Hop
  Composition over LLM-Extracted Atoms PLUS a Training-Free, Per-Edge, Gold-Free Abstain-on-Collapse CERTIFICATE (demonstrated
  end-to-end on TEMPLATED CLUTRR; marginal on natural temporal text); the NOVEL Cross-Path-Intersection Error-Correcting-Code
  Mechanism Remains SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL-ONLY and Awaits a Real Multi-Path-Redundancy Test; Real-Text Utility is Extraction-Limited
  (~0.53 Atomic Recall -> ~19% Coverage)
hypothesis: |-
  LEAD -- SIX CLAIMS, HONESTLY TIERED BY EVIDENCE CLASS AND BY *WHERE EACH HOLDS* (read first; everything below elaborates). The contribution is scoped to the DEDUCTION SUB-MODULE of a text->FOL/Prolog pipeline. Four scope facts are stated UP FRONT in title/abstract/intro and never implied as delivered: (a) atomic extraction is MEASURED, not improved (CLUTRR P/R/F1 ~= 0.536/0.532/0.534); (b) OpenCyc/upper-ontology grounding is OUT OF SCOPE; (c) the LLM-as-probabilistic-reasoner-for-FUZZY-UNIFICATION over implicit/common-sense composition is OUT OF SCOPE -- in EVERY venue we run the composition table is HAND-SUPPLIED (Allen/point/RCC-8 published tables; CLUTRR rules_store.yaml), so the LLM only extracts atoms and never resolves implicit composition; (d) real-text utility is structurally EXTRACTION-LIMITED -- at ~0.53 atomic recall Mode-A commits to only ~19% of natural-text queries, so heavy abstention is a direct consequence of the read, not a design choice. Consider re-titling the paper to center "closure-certified deduction sub-module" rather than the full pipeline.

      iter-3 powered the prior "open negative," and the result SPLITS the contribution along the exact evidence boundary the reviewer drew, which this revision now adopts as its ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE:
      * WHAT TRANSFERS to (semi-)real text at statistical power = the INHERITED neuro-symbolic premise (compose with the EXACT TABLE, not with the LLM) PLUS a TRAINING-FREE, PER-EDGE, GOLD-FREE ABSTAIN-ON-COLLAPSE CERTIFICATE. The certificate is the genuinely portable novelty.
      * WHAT REMAINS SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL-ONLY = the paper's SIGNATURE NOVEL mechanism: multi-path redundancy as an ERROR-CORRECTING CODE, in which cross-path INTERSECTION of disjunctive LLM reads narrows the query toward gold (Mode A), governed by an inverted-U coding rate. NEITHER real venue actually tested this mechanism (Claim 2). The prior reviewer's "central comparative contribution is synthetic-only" concern is therefore NOT retired -- it is RECAST, and we now say so plainly.

      (CLAIM 1 -- THE TRANSFERABLE CONTRIBUTION: INHERITED EXACT-TABLE COMPOSITION + GOLD-FREE CERTIFICATE, confirmed at power. TAG: REAL-LLM-READ.) Reading atoms span-locally with a real LLM, feeding an EXACT composition table, and ABSTAINING when closure leaves a non-singleton beats per-path neural reasoning and voting at MATCHED COVERAGE: on CLUTRR Mode-A selective accuracy 0.886 @ matched coverage 0.686 vs Path-of-Thoughts 0.457 (gap +0.429, CI [0.298,0.557], Holm p_adj=0.0015), self-consistency 0.557, raw-LLM 0.543; on 600 NATURAL temporal-document deduction queries Mode-A beats PoT (gap +0.027, p=0.007) and self-consistency (+0.035), both Holm-adjusted. HONESTY: this win is LARGELY the inherited premise + structural abstention, NOT the novel coding mechanism. On the rich Allen algebra the +0.676 system gap DECOMPOSES (art_D0cHQUJ8kY75) into +0.673 INHERITED (an LLM composes 13-relation Allen poorly: PoT 0.308) plus only +0.0025 novel on the selective-accuracy axis. Report this decomposition wherever the system gap appears; the actionable framing of the inherited part is "use exact tables instead of LLM composition," which is the standard neuro-symbolic premise, not our discovery.

      (CLAIM 2 -- THE NOVEL CODING / CROSS-PATH-INTERSECTION MECHANISM IS SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL-ONLY; powering it on real text is the DECISIVE OPEN EXPERIMENT. TAG: SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL.) The error-correcting-code mechanism -- cross-path INTERSECTION of multiple disjunctive reads arriving at the SAME query pair, narrowing toward gold under an inverted-U coding rate -- is established at power ONLY on the synthetic channel, whose per-edge recall and within-document error correlation rho are CONTROLLED INPUTS. Neither real venue tests it:
        - CLUTRR uses a DIFFERENT ALGORITHM. Kinship relations have no involutive converse, so the Mackworth PC-2 converse-INTERSECTION closure is UNSOUND there (it collapses ~13% of gold-clean chains to empty); the sound engine is a forward least-fixpoint UNION derivation over SINGLE CHAINS (kinship.py forward union; the worked Lena->Irvin->James->Lynn case is sequential transitive composition with near-singleton kinship reads and NO redundant constraining paths). So CLUTRR exercises the inherited exact-table premise + basic multi-hop closure + abstention -- it does NOT exercise cross-path intersection. We MUST NOT present "on CLUTRR the iteration term is large and load-bearing" without stating that CLUTRR's "iteration" is single-chain transitive composition under a UNION fixpoint, NOT the cross-path INTERSECTION that is the paper's claimed novelty.
        - On NATURAL temporal text the iteration signature is ABSENT at power (art_OETjJkketEVS): full-vs-naive single-pass gap +0.027, p=0.079 (NOT significant); the >=3-edge/cyclic full-vs-naive stratum +0.042, p=0.061 (NOT significant, EXPLORATORY); the synthetic channel "carries H3." Reason: dense NarrativeTime is near-transitively closed so full==naive (full_only=0); sparse TDDMan has the iteration signal but only ~12 such held-out edges.
      DECISIVE iter-4 EXPERIMENT (the one that would actually validate the headline novelty on real text): IDENTIFY or CONSTRUCT real-text deduction queries with GENUINE MULTI-PATH REDUNDANCY -- entity pairs reachable via >=2 DISJOINT constraining paths that are NOT individually transitively trivial -- and show AT POWER that cross-path INTERSECTION narrows beyond single-path composition (adjusted-CI separation). This must thread the needle between dense corpora (redundant but transitively-closed => no iteration bite) and sparse corpora (iteration bite but few multi-path-redundant queries). If this stratum cannot be sourced at adequate power this round, the coding/intersection result is EXPLICITLY labeled a synthetic-channel mechanism finding, and the real-text contribution is honestly stated as "inherited exact-table multi-hop composition + a gold-free abstain-on-collapse certificate." DISCONFIRM/SCOPE-BOUNDARY stands: if cross-path intersection never narrows beyond single-path composition on ANY real multi-path-redundant stratum at power, the coding mechanism is a synthetic-only contribution.

      (CLAIM 3 -- END-TO-END DELIVERABLES, landed on CLUTRR with honest caveats. TAG: REAL-LLM-READ.) One CLUTRR run (art_0a7i481ZRwS1) delivers all four pipeline goal items: (i) atomic P/R/F1 0.536/0.532/0.534 (HELD-FIXED control, NOT a claim to improve extraction; ~0.376/0.543/0.444 under disconnected-story noise); (ii) multi-hop accuracy that holds 0.80-1.00 through 10-hop chains while raw collapses (hop-3 0.444 -> hop-10 0.0) and PoT degrades (0.357 -> 0.20); (iii) traces ACTUALLY EXECUTED in SWI-Prolog 9.0.4 -- 40/40 run, 40/40 match the Python engine, 39/40 match gold (the one miss is a read recall failure, not a closure error); (iv) absent-relation hallucination reduction 0.444 (raw confident-wrong 0.472 vs Mode-A 0.028, CI [0.317,0.583], clears the pre-registered 0.20 bar), reported as a RISK-COVERAGE tradeoff on a MIXED present/absent pool (n=282; Mode-A answers 26.6% @ confident-wrong 4.6%) so that abstain-on-everything cannot win. HONEST CAVEATS, FOREGROUNDED (reviewer scope MAJOR): CLUTRR is a TEMPLATED kinship benchmark (semi-synthetic), max 871 chars (NONE reach the ~3000-char target), entity grounding uses GOLD surface forms, and the composition table is hand-supplied -- so CLUTRR is "an established but TEMPLATED benchmark," NOT "natural, non-synthetic text," and the abstract must NOT claim "two non-synthetic venues." The gold-read oracle (Mode-A 1.00 @ coverage 0.951 vs 0.433 for raw/PoT) confirms the symbolic closure is NOT the bottleneck -- the neural read is (atomic recall ~0.53).

      (CLAIM 4 -- THE CERTIFICATE IS WEAKLY PROTECTIVE ON NATURAL TEMPORAL TEXT; temper faithfulness-by-abstention. TAG: REAL-LLM-READ.) On natural temporal text the raw LLM OUT-ACCURACIES Mode-A at matched coverage (0.699 vs 0.575, gap -0.124), and among the ~19% of queries Mode-A commits to it is CONFIDENT-WRONG 42.5% (48/113). Report the 42.5%-confident-wrong-among-answered figure PROMINENTLY beside every temporal claim. The certificate does NOT reliably protect on dense temporal prose at ~0.85 recall, because the SILENT-WRONG-NARROWING failure mode (gold OMITTED from a contributing set => confident wrong singleton with NO collapse) is UNDETECTABLE by closure. Mode-A's temporal value is therefore the gold-free certificate + abstention as an OPTION, not selective-accuracy dominance -- and even that protection is bounded by read recall.

      (CLAIM 5 -- ALGEBRA-RICHNESS SCALING LAW, real reads on SYNTHETIC NL, largely the inherited effect. TAG: REAL-LLM-READ-ON-SYNTHETIC.) The advantage over PoT grows monotonically with base-relation count: point(3) +0.043 -> RCC-8(8) +0.448 -> Allen(13) +0.676 (art_QToTkRe6Umb8; RCC-8/Allen are SOUND LOWER BOUNDS since PC is incomplete for them). Mechanistic reading: a coarse algebra rarely gives the LLM more than one plausible composition so the symbolic step is redundant; richer branching lets free neural composition accumulate locally-fluent-but-globally-inconsistent steps the exact table eliminates. STATE that this scaling is the INHERITED table-vs-LLM-composition effect measured across algebras (REAL-LLM-READ-ON-SYNTHETIC, templated NL at recall ~1.0), NOT new evidence of the coding mechanism.

      (CLAIM 6 -- REDUNDANCY INVERTED-U, a synthetic-channel property. TAG: SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL.) On a realism-matched channel (art_FtN4LBzazO_l; per-edge error-type TV <= 0.0065 projected / 0.007 Allen; recall ladder reproduced to max-err 0.003) iterated closure error-corrects per recall slice: full-minus-naive gap is a structural 0.0 at L=2 and grows with hop and cyclomatic number (Page p ~= 5e-4, CORRECTED from the paper's mis-stated 1e-13), the gap itself recall-dependent (maxL 0.22 -> 0.885 as recall 0.572 -> 1.0); net Mode-A resolution is an inverted-U with peak K* = 2,4,7,10,16 for recall 0.5 -> 0.95; silent-wrong rises 0.006 -> 0.146 as recall falls, bounded by (1-r) per-edge and (1-J(E)) per-network. RETAINED HONEST CAVEAT: recall and rho are INPUTS, so this CHARACTERIZES the mechanism; it does NOT predict a real-text operating point.

      READ-SOUNDNESS FRONTIER -- RESOLVED AT POWER, CORPUS-SPECIFIC. TAG: REAL-LLM-READ. At n~=160 stronger-reader edges/corpus (art_OETjJkketEVS): NarrativeTime stronger reader 0.932 (CI [0.888,0.967], STRADDLES the 0.90 point gate) while primary is 0.856 (below); TDDMan stays below even when stronger (0.819 / primary 0.828). The earlier single-reader TDDMan "0.902 crossing" did NOT replicate (small-sample noise). Conclusion: local read-soundness IS the binding real-text constraint, IMPROVABLE into the gate regime on dense news prose by a stronger reader but BELOW gate on discourse-level manual gold -- a corpus/genre effect, NOT a universal model ceiling. rho is positive (0.03-0.17), as the channel assumes. A $0 synthetic backstop closes the loop: at recall 0.96 Mode-A beats raw by +0.225 at matched coverage, isolating read-soundness (not closure) as the real-text gate.

      REPORTING-RIGOR FIXES (each tied to a reviewer MINOR). (R1) The temporal H1 gap +0.0265 had a bootstrap CI [0.045,0.315] that does NOT contain the point estimate (a re-matching-coverage-inside-the-bootstrap artifact); iter-4 must report a CI that BRACKETS the observed gap (percentile of the matched-gap distribution) or fix the matching procedure. (R2) The CLUTRR naive baseline was FORCE-EXTENDED from its natural coverage 0.216 to the matched 0.686 with "representative surface" answers, so the 0.229 matched selective accuracy anchoring the "0.229 -> 0.886" contrast is partly a FORCED-UP artifact; the CLUTRR table must add naive's NATURAL-coverage selective accuracy and FLAG force-extension in the caption, and the iteration claim must be ROUTED THROUGH THE COVERAGE AXIS (full-minus-naive coverage gap 0.0 @ hop-2, 0.586 @ hop-3, up to 0.875 @ hop-9 -- genuinely supported) rather than the forced selective-accuracy contrast.

      NOVELTY, SHARPENED TO WHAT IS UNIQUELY DEMONSTRATED END-TO-END ON A REAL BENCHMARK (reviewer novelty MINOR). The machinery (path consistency over relation algebras; abstention on non-singleton query edges) is classical QSR (Allen, Mackworth, GQR, SputLink). The end-to-end-demonstrated novelty is a TRAINING-FREE, PER-EDGE, GOLD-FREE ABSTAIN-ON-COLLAPSE CERTIFICATE over LLM-extracted relational facts that inverts the F1-maximizing commit contract -- SEPARATED CLEANLY from the coding-rate / cross-path-intersection thesis, which is exercised ONLY synthetically. Add the two nearest non-matching neighbors the scout flagged -- GDLLM (arXiv:2508.20828) and BeDiscovER (arXiv:2511.13095) -- alongside the already-pinned NeSTR (2512.07218), TReMu (Findings-ACL 2025), Consistent Discourse-level TRE (Findings-EMNLP 2025), and "When Silence Is Golden" (2602.04755), differentiating: we PRESERVE a relation-algebra disjunction and ABSTAIN on closure-collapse (gold-free, training-free, per-edge) versus their single-label COMMIT / abductive-REPAIR / TRAINED-abstention objectives.

      OPTIONAL STRETCH (touches the goal's "fuzzy unification" gap, clearly labeled exploratory). A MINIMAL demonstration of ONE LLM-resolved composition step where the symbolic table has a GAP (an undefined composition cell filled by a probabilistic LLM read), to substantiate the neuro-symbolic framing the motivation invokes -- WITHOUT overclaiming OpenCyc grounding or full fuzzy unification. If not run, state explicitly that LLM fuzzy-unification over implicit composition is out of scope this round.

      MODE A (SOUND NARROWING, PRIMARY, READ-SOUNDNESS-CONDITIONAL zero-FP). The local reader emits per span a high-recall sub-universal disjunction (with an explicit universal/underdetermined option); intersecting the compositions arriving at the query pair from multiple constraining paths yields a still-sound, strictly-tighter set. The load-bearing metric is SINGLETON-RESOLUTION-TO-CORRECT. Its zero-FP property survives PC incompleteness (intersection of sound sets is sound) but is CONDITIONAL on every contributing read being sound. CRITICAL: the cross-path-INTERSECTION variant of Mode A is the SYNTHETIC-ONLY novelty at power (Claim 2); on the converse-closed temporal algebras the multi-path narrowing did not separate at power, and CLUTRR uses a union-fixpoint, not intersection.
      MODE B (DETECTION/REPAIR, SECONDARY). An empty closure certifies that some read is UNSOUND -- a gold-free, zero-FP DETECTION flag (conditional on recall) -- carrying the SILENT-WRONG-NARROWING dual (an unsound set OMITTING gold drives a confident WRONG singleton with no collapse; this is exactly the undetectable failure behind Claim 4's 42.5% confident-wrong). Reiter-style minimal-hitting-set repair is scoped as future work.
      ITERATION ISOLATION. Naive = single-pass query-node intersection ("PoT plus one obvious intersection step"); it COINCIDES with full closure on length-2 multi-path queries (verified) and diverges on >=3-edge/cyclic structure. The full-minus-naive gap isolates ITERATED path-consistency, but at power on REAL text this gap is NOT significant (temporal +0.027 p=0.079; >=3-edge/cyclic +0.042 p=0.061); on CLUTRR it is genuine only on the COVERAGE axis; the clean iteration evidence remains SYNTHETIC.
      LOCAL-READER REGIME (load-bearing definition). A local-only reader sees ONLY the minimal span(s) where two events/entities co-occur; edges it confidently and correctly names are DIRECTLY-READABLE, the rest are DEDUCTION-REQUIRED. The honest pipeline reads atomically/locally to populate the KB, THEN composes, so closure's value is measured against a LOCAL reader, never a full-context oracle.
      REDUNDANCY AS A CODING RATE, audited on EMPIRICAL JOINT SOUNDNESS (SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL). Instead of the independence product prod_e r_e we MEASURE empirical joint soundness J(E) and report cross-edge error correlation rho; the inverted-U cost term is 1-J(E); positive rho makes J(E) decay slower than r^E, pushing the peak outward. iter-2/3 confirmed J(E)>r^E and a contains-gold-on-J(E) slope 0.65 (<1: convex algebra absorbs single unsound reads -- the certificate over-delivers).

      GENERALITY, TEMPERED. EXACT only on the convex point algebra (PC complete); Allen IA and RCC-8 numbers are SOUND LOWER BOUNDS (PC incomplete); RCC-8 was RUN as a synthetic real-LLM arm (scaling curve). CLUTRR kinship is a finite UNION composition table, NOT a relation algebra, and -- crucially -- NOT a cross-path-intersection venue. Generality is scoped to "demonstrated on convex point (exact) + Allen (lower bound) + RCC-8 (lower bound) + CLUTRR kinship union-table (end-to-end)."

      SUCCESS. CONFIRM if: (NOVEL MECHANISM, the still-open one) at power on a REAL multi-path-redundant stratum, cross-path INTERSECTION narrows beyond single-path composition with adjusted-CI separation; (TRANSFER, already met) inherited composition + certificate beat PoT and voting at matched coverage on >=1 real/semi-real venue (CLUTRR met decisively; temporal met but marginal); (DELIVERABLES, met) a SWI-Prolog-EXECUTED end-to-end pipeline reports atomic P/R, multi-hop accuracy vs length, a trace-graph, and a risk-coverage hallucination reduction >= the pre-registered minimum. DISCONFIRM / SCOPE-BOUNDARY (each publishable): cross-path intersection never beats single-path composition on any real multi-path-redundant stratum at power (=> coding mechanism is honestly synthetic-only); the natural-text comparative advantage is marginal AND the certificate is weakly protective (already observed on temporal); or no realism-matched channel reproduces the inverted-U.

      HONESTY COMMITMENTS. (1) TAG every number THEOREM / SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL / GOLD-ONLY-GATE / REAL-LLM-READ / REAL-LLM-READ-ON-SYNTHETIC. (2) Do NOT call CLUTRR "non-synthetic / natural text" -- it is a TEMPLATED kinship benchmark; the only genuinely natural text is the temporal corpora, where the contribution is marginal. (3) Do NOT present CLUTRR's single-chain UNION-fixpoint composition as the cross-path INTERSECTION mechanism. (4) The cross-path-intersection / coding-rate mechanism is SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL-ONLY until powered on a real multi-path-redundant stratum. (5) zero-FP is READ-SOUNDNESS-CONDITIONAL; on natural temporal text the certificate is WEAKLY protective (42.5% confident-wrong among answered; raw out-accuracies Mode-A by 0.124). (6) the +0.676 system gap is DECOMPOSED into inherited (+0.673) and novel-on-selacc (+0.0025). (7) report every hallucination number WITH coverage/abstention. (8) SWI-Prolog execution reported truthfully (executed; 40/40 engine, 39/40 gold). (9) the contribution is the DEDUCTION SUB-MODULE only -- OpenCyc grounding, atomic re-extraction, and LLM fuzzy-unification are OUT OF SCOPE; real-text utility is extraction-limited (~0.53 recall => ~19% Mode-A coverage), foregrounded in abstract/intro. (10) FIX the CI-bracketing (R1) and naive-force-extension (R2) reporting issues. (11) include one concrete worked example (one Mode-A narrowing, one Mode-B collapse) and a compact notation/metric table.
motivation: >-
  Faithful multi-hop relational reasoning over short professional text -- temporal ordering of events in news, kinship in
  narratives, containment/region relations in descriptions -- is where LLM hallucination is most damaging and where a text-to-logic
  pipeline most needs to fuse explicit document facts with implicit composition knowledge while staying auditable. The umbrella
  pipeline reads text into FOL/Prolog predicates, types entities against an upper ontology, and answers queries with a reasoner;
  the WEAK LINK is the composition/deduction step. Existing systems handle composition unsatisfyingly: humans hand-craft composition
  rules (the kinship rules behind CLUTRR), which do not scale; the LLM composes freely, locally fluent but globally inconsistent,
  producing silent errors that solver-crash feedback (Logic-LM) and answer voting (LINC) cannot see; or paths are reasoned
  in ISOLATION (LAMBADA, Path-of-Thoughts), which deliberately avoids the global check and so cannot tighten a disjunctive
  query by intersecting evidence from multiple paths nor detect contradictions arriving at the same pair from two paths. A
  cluster of negative/commit-contract results sharpens the opportunity: Knez & Sun (2024, arXiv:2406.11486) show zero-shot
  LLMs assign MORE THAN ONE temporal relation to a pair for >=50% (up to 97%) of pairs and violate transitivity, then enforce
  consistency with ILP and find it DOES NOT improve F1; and -- decisively up to date -- a 2025 global zero-shot temporal-graph
  generator (arXiv:2502.11114, EMNLP 2025) STILL enforces uniqueness/symmetry/transitivity by ILP, committing to a single
  label per pair, preserving no disjunction, issuing no certificate, and offering no abstention. We read this lineage as evidence
  that consistency enforcement under the F1-maximizing COMMIT contract is the wrong objective; the LLM's native multi-relation
  output is not noise to be collapsed but a SOUND DISJUNCTION to be PRESERVED and NARROWED, and the right objective is faithfulness-by-abstention,
  not extraction F1. The qualitative-reasoning community has had exact, commodity-cheap path-consistency algorithms over relation
  algebras (Allen 1983; Renz & Nebel; GQR, SparQ) for forty years, but they assume a clean hand-given table and have never
  been coupled to an LLM reading relations off natural language. We are NOT the first to run closure over machine-extracted
  temporal relations (SputLink densifies TimeBank; CAEVO does global temporal inference via cascaded sieves; Ning et al.'s
  ILP enforces transitivity) -- but ALL COMMIT to a single consistent labeling to maximize F1, preserving no disjunction,
  certifying no reading error, offering no abstention. Our contribution is the OPPOSITE output contract: keep the LLM's job
  as high-recall disjunctive READING, use cross-path INTERSECTION as a zero-FP faithfulness operation (Mode A) and closure
  COLLAPSE as a gold-free reading-error certificate (Mode B), and optimize faithfulness via a risk-coverage objective. Three
  ideas make the transfer a genuine contribution rather than a port. FIRST, because Allen/point/RCC-8 tables are EXACT ground
  truth, cross-path intersection of SOUND sets can only move toward gold -- a calibration-free, zero-FP narrowing that needs
  no over-commitment and no labels, and multi-path redundancy becomes an ERROR-CORRECTING CODE over LLM extractions. SECOND,
  the coding-theory lens predicts an OPTIMAL RATE: narrowing stays zero-FP only while all contributing edges are sound and
  that JOINT probability (measured EMPIRICALLY as J(E), not assumed independent) decays with redundancy, so net benefit is
  an INVERTED-U whose peak we predict from measured recall and the measured cross-edge error correlation and shift with a
  recall-floor gate. THIRD, the objective inverts F1 -- we preserve disjunctive uncertainty and ABSTAIN, trading coverage
  for faithfulness, and we measure the ACTIONABLE yield (intersection-to-correct-singleton at matched coverage) and the DOWNSTREAM
  hallucination-rate reduction, not whether a set merely shrank. The decisive realism move this iteration is choosing the
  corpus that can ACTUALLY host the claim: MATRES annotates only same/adjacent-sentence pairs, so its deduction-required envelope
  is empty BY CONSTRUCTION; the headline must live on a DENSE, direct-human-gold corpus (NarrativeTime, full TLink coverage,
  human-timeline gold) and be corroborated where gold is provably non-closure-derived (TDDMan long-distance manual pairs).
  If it works, this is a general, training-free recipe for trustworthy relational deduction over text with quantified, certificate-backed
  hallucination reduction and replayable trace-graphs; if it fails (intersection rarely resolves correct singletons because
  real sets are near-universal; the redundancy peak sits at trivially low redundancy; recall failures dominate the joint-soundness
  bound; or even the dense corpus's deduction-required multi-path-with-bite slice is below the pre-registered applicability
  number), each is itself a publishable scope boundary on repairing LLM-read relational knowledge.

  ARM-SCOPED CLAIMS + DENSE-CORPUS RELOCATION (resolves the prior contradiction AND the MATRES-locality problem). The real-text
  narrowing/hallucination win is claimed on a DENSE direct-human-gold corpus's deduction-required multi-path subset (NarrativeTime
  CO-PRIMARY; TDDMan non-circularity corroboration), NOT on MATRES, which is EXPECTED TO FAIL the deduction-required gate
  by construction (same/adjacent-sentence annotation -> all gold local). Mode A beats path-isolated Path-of-Thoughts and answer-voting;
  it TIES naive single-pass intersection on length-2 queries; FULL ITERATED closure beats naive ONLY where >=3-edge/cyclic
  structure exists -- now demonstrated on synthetic AND, where T0 finds a usable real-text stratum, on real text.

  CORPUS ALGEBRA & NON-CIRCULARITY CHARACTERIZED A-PRIORI FOR ALL CORPORA (before any LLM spend). NarrativeTime gold = HUMAN
  TIMELINE placement (manual, full TLink coverage, IAA alpha ~0.68), restrictable to START-POINTS -> CONVEX POINT ALGEBRA
  where PC is COMPLETE and the table exact (full-interval Allen scored as a lower-bound detector); its non-local gold is human-holistic,
  NOT algorithmic-closure output, so closure recovery over independently-read edges is non-circular -- quantified by the LOCALLY-JUSTIFIABLE
  vs PURELY-TIMELINE-IMPLIED fraction. TDDMan gold = direct human annotation of long-distance pairs explicitly NOT auto-inferable
  -> a structurally non-circular anchor whose win moots the timeline-circularity worry. Mode A's zero-FP soundness SURVIVES
  PC incompleteness (intersection of sound sets is always sound), so the mechanism is not lost where completeness fails.
- >-
  REDUNDANCY IS DOUBLE-EDGED, AUDITED ON EMPIRICAL JOINT SOUNDNESS (no independence assumption). Mode A's zero-FP narrowing
  holds only when ALL contributing edges are sound. We MEASURE the empirical joint soundness J(E) and report the within-document
  cross-edge reading-error correlation rho. Net Mode-A gain is an INVERTED-U in redundancy at fixed recall, cost term 1 -
  J(E), peak located using empirical J(E); positive rho pushes the peak outward. A flat/non-monotone curve is the predicted
  recall x redundancy interaction, not a disconfirmation.

  A-PRIORI ENVELOPE GATE EXTENDED TO ALL CORPORA + CONCRETE APPLICABILITY THRESHOLD. From each gold graph alone (zero LLM
  spend) we count N* (deduction-required AND >=2-path AND bite-after-widening AND singleton-resolving) AND the >=3-edge/cyclic
  prevalence (the real-text iteration envelope), with a paired-bootstrap power calc, for NarrativeTime, TDDMan AND MATRES;
  we report widening-induced bite loss; and we pre-register the applicability-envelope threshold as a NUMBER (deduction-required
  multi-path-with-bite fraction >=10% of evaluable held-out edges = 'general mechanism'; 5-10% = 'useful module'; <5% = 'niche
  safety-net'). The headline is never contingent on an unmeasured quantity.

  ACTIONABLE YIELD = SINGLETON-RESOLUTION-TO-CORRECT + DOWNSTREAM HALLUCINATION REDUCTION, AND RECALL-AND-RHO-MATCHED READER-AGNOSTICITY.
  The matched-coverage win and the hallucination-rate drop are both driven by intersection-to-correct-SINGLETON (strict-tightening
  reported separately, stated non-load-bearing); the coverage axis (single-relation resolution) is applied IDENTICALLY to
  closure and every baseline. The gain is attributable to the ALGEBRA: swapping the disjunctive edge-reader preserves the
  gain when each alternative reader is tuned to MATCHED per-edge recall AND its rho is reported (conditioned on rho if it
  differs materially), so reader-specific error correlation cannot confound the conclusion.

  TIERING (pre-committed; T0 then Tier-1 must COMPLETE before Tier-2; a fully-executed T0+Tier-1 with a thin Tier-2 is the acceptable minimum publishable unit). T0 -- A-PRIORI ENVELOPE GATE FOR ALL CORPORA (zero LLM spend): from each gold graph compute N* (deduction-required AND >=2-path AND bite-after-widening AND singleton-resolving), the >=3-edge/cyclic prevalence, the widening-induced bite loss, and a paired-bootstrap power calc, for NarrativeTime, TDDMan AND MATRES; for NarrativeTime also compute the locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied split (non-circularity audit, structural proxy only). Decide hosting via the pre-registered applicability NUMBER; the expected MATRES N* ~ 0 vs NarrativeTime/TDDMan N* >> 0 is reported as gate validation. TIER-1 (headline-critical, on the dense co-primary): (T1) the RECALL-BITE FRONTIER map + pre-registered go/no-go; (T2) the real-text Mode-A comparison vs Path-of-Thoughts and self-consistency at MATCHED COVERAGE with paired-bootstrap CIs, stratified by deduction-required vs directly-readable; (T2b) the END-TO-END HALLUCINATION-REDUCTION on the deduction-required/absent-relation subset vs a raw LLM, with a PRE-REGISTERED minimum effect size; (T3) the SYNTHETIC long-hop/cyclic redundancy-scaling DECOMPOSITION separating Mode-A BENEFIT from silent-narrowing COST, locating the inverted-U peak, conditioning the zero-FP audit on EMPIRICAL J(E), PLUS a coarse REAL-TEXT decomposition anchor binned by contributing-edge count; (T4) the isolating ablations -- closure ON/OFF table-held-fixed, Mode-A-only, and NAIVE-INTERSECTION vs FULL ITERATED closure with hop/cyclomatic stratification ON BOTH synthetic AND the dense corpus's real >=3-edge/cyclic stratum (the iteration claim). TIER-2 (runs only after Tier-1): TDDMan non-circularity replication, RCC-8 second algebra, CLUTRR elicited-table ablation + absent-relation end-to-end demo, TimeBank-Dense (framed noisy-read-vs-clean-read), Mode-B repair quality, the METRE-style alternative-reader ablation, exploratory semiring variant.

  MULTIPLICITY POLICY (pre-registered; inoculates against a garden-of-forking-paths objection). CONFIRMATORY FAMILY (Holm-Bonferroni / hierarchical gatekeeping across the family; report ADJUSTED CIs): (H1) real-text Mode-A selective-accuracy gap vs PoT & voting; (H2) end-to-end hallucination-rate reduction vs raw LLM; (H3) full-minus-naive iteration gap growing with hop/cyclomatic; (H4) the single redundancy inverted-U disconfirmer. H1 and H2 are the gateway tests; H3/H4 are tested only if a gateway clears. EVERYTHING ELSE -- per-stratum splits, per-bin curves, reader-agnosticity, Mode-B repair, RCC-8/CLUTRR/TB-Dense, the real-text iteration stratum (corroborative) -- is EXPLORATORY, reported with nominal CIs and labelled as such.

  EMPIRICAL-J(E) ATTRIBUTION RULE (stated ONCE here): a reliability-slope offset that DISAPPEARS when the predictor is switched from the independence product r^E to empirical J(E) is the independence approximation failing (NOT a disconfirmation); an offset that PERSISTS under empirical J(E) is a genuine soundness failure. ESCALATION LADDER (stated ONCE here): the dense direct-human-gold CO-PRIMARY is NarrativeTime if its T0 N* clears the applicability number; TDDMan corroborates and supplies a non-circularity-clean (and harder) arm; MATRES is the gate-validation control; if NO real corpus clears the number even after these, the synthetic arm becomes the headline and real text is demoted to an honestly-scoped niche-safety-net boundary -- but T0 makes that decision before LLM spend.

  COMPACT LOGICAL STRUCTURE (claim -> precondition -> metric -> baseline -> CI test). [H1 REAL-TEXT NARROWING] Mode-A singleton-resolution-to-correct > PoT & self-consistency (ties naive-intersection) -> precondition: dense-corpus deduction-required multi-path-with-bite subset with N* powering the CI (from T0) -> metric: selective accuracy at matched coverage -> baselines: PoT (path-agreement abstain), self-consistency (vote margin) -> paired-bootstrap adjusted CI on the gap, separated from 0. [H2 HALLUCINATION REDUCTION] closure pipeline confident-wrong rate < raw-LLM on the absent-relation subset -> precondition: same subset -> metric: confident-wrong (non-abstained gold-mismatch) rate -> baseline: raw LLM forced to a single relation -> paired-bootstrap adjusted CI meeting the pre-registered minimum effect. [H3 ITERATION] full closure > naive-intersection, gap grows with hop/cyclomatic -> precondition: paths longer than 2 / cycles present (synthetic; real >=3-edge/cyclic stratum) -> metric: selective-accuracy gap vs hop-count bin -> baseline: naive single-pass intersection -> per-bin adjusted CI + monotone-trend test. [H4 REDUNDANCY OPTIMUM] net gain inverted-U with located peak; peak increases with recall; gate shifts it -> precondition: >=4 fixed per-edge-recall arms + estimation-precision pre-reg -> metric: separate benefit and cost curves vs redundancy (synthetic + coarse real anchor) -> peak-detection meeting the >=1-bin shift bar. [C2 PATH-CONSISTENCY] closure ON > OFF, table held FIXED -> paired bootstrap (exploratory). [C3 ZERO-FP AUDIT] realized fraction-still-contains-gold tracks EMPIRICAL J(E), slope ~1 (exploratory). [C5 READER-AGNOSTIC] gain persists under swapped reader at matched recall AND reported rho (exploratory). [C6 MODE-B] zero-FP DETECTION; repair toward gold (exploratory).

  PILOT AS A FRONTIER MAP (after T0, before main runs). On synthetic and real edges, SWEEP a prompt-elicited breadth knob across >=5 settings from 'name THE relation' to 'name the maximal SOUND set the text does not exclude.' At each setting MEASURE: per-edge RECALL = P(gold in emitted set); breadth distribution; over-commitment vs under-specification rate; raw closure-collapse rate; strict-tightening AND singleton-resolution-to-correct yields; local-only-reader accuracy defining the deduction-required fraction; and the within-document cross-edge reading-error correlation rho. PLOT the RECALL-BITE FRONTIER as a primary deliverable and pre-register go/no-go (a region clearing a recall gate AND non-trivial singleton-resolution-to-correct) BEFORE any main run. PRE-REGISTER the EXTENDED REALISM-MATCHING STATISTIC for the synthetic NL-realization: total-variation distance between real and synthetic per-edge error-type distributions PLUS a cross-edge error-CORRELATION (rho) match term PLUS a redundancy/path-topology match (contributing-edge-count and cycle-structure histograms), thresholds FIXED before generating the redundancy curve.

  PIPELINE (four stages). (1) NEURAL READING -- prompt the LLM (via OpenRouter, cheap model, short docs, caching; well under $10) to map each surface relation phrase onto a SOUND DISJUNCTION of canonical base relations at the pre-registered frontier operating point; for the NarrativeTime point-algebra arm restrict emitted vocabulary to CONVEX point relations on start-points (widen non-convex {<,>} to VAGUE) so PC stays COMPLETE, and MEASURE the bite lost. (2) ALGEBRA -- use the EXACT published composition table (Allen 13-relation, point algebra, RCC-8; the convex table for the coarse interval label sets); seed converses/identity from the algebra, never from an LLM. (3) SYMBOLIC CLOSURE -- build a QCN (nodes=events/entities, edges=relation SETS; query/held-out edge starts universal), run path-consistency to a FIXPOINT. Three instrumented variants: FULL iterated PC; NAIVE single-pass intersection at the query node (no fixpoint, no converse seeding); closure-OFF (table fixed). MODE A narrows by cross-path intersection and emits an answer ONLY when the query resolves to a single relation (coverage axis), else ABSTAINS. MODE B (Tier-2): an empty collapse CERTIFIES a reading error; compute a minimal Reiter-style hitting-set/MaxSAT repair preferring lowest-confidence edges, recording the diagnosis and flagging possible mislocalization. (4) AUDIT -- emit the QCN, which compositions fired on which paths, and repairs as a TRACE-GRAPH, optionally discharged in SWI-Prolog/ASP from the closed table for a replayable proof (connective tissue to the umbrella pipeline's auditability + quantified-hallucination-reduction requirements).

  DATASETS. DENSE REAL-TEXT CO-PRIMARY: NarrativeTime / TimeBankNT (Rogers et al., LREC-COLING 2024; arXiv:1908.11443) -- timeline-based FULL-coverage human re-annotation of TimeBank-Dense (news), IAA alpha ~0.68; start-point restriction -> convex point algebra (PC COMPLETE), full-interval arm as lower-bound detector; non-local gold is HUMAN-timeline-placed (non-circular vs algorithmic PC). NON-CIRCULARITY ANCHOR: TDDMan (Naik et al., TDDiscourse 2019; aclanthology W19-5929) -- MANUAL long-distance (>1-sentence-apart) pairs that 'cannot be inferred automatically from existing annotations'; relation set {before, after, simultaneous, includes, is_included}, mutually exclusive (no VAGUE), coarse interval algebra; cleanest non-circularity, used to replicate the narrowing win where gold is provably not a closure artifact. GATE-VALIDATION CONTROL: MATRES (Ning, Wu & Roth 2018) -- same/adjacent-sentence annotation, expected N* ~ 0 on the deduction-required gate, demonstrating the gate discriminates. SYNTHETIC PRIMARY (clean ground truth, controlled redundancy): a Renz-Nebel-style random consistent Allen/point QCN generator GUARANTEEING redundant paths/cycles and sweeping redundancy/density/hop-count INDEPENDENTLY; the NL-realization protocol is VALIDATED to clear the EXTENDED realism statistic; the redundancy DECOMPOSITION is reported at >=4 FIXED per-edge-recall levels with >=500 networks per cell. SECOND ALGEBRA: RCC-8 synthetic. ELICITED-TABLE VENUE: CLUTRR kinship (LLM-elicited table vs gold) doubling as an end-to-end hallucination-reduction-on-ABSENT-relation demo. TimeBank-Dense as a Tier-2 noisy-read-vs-clean-read arm; RuleTaker an out-of-scope propositional contrast.

  KEY ABLATIONS: (i) closure/intersection ON vs OFF with the table HELD FIXED; (ii) NAIVE single-pass vs FULL iterated closure with hop/cyclomatic stratification (synthetic + real); (iii) Mode A ONLY vs Mode A+B; (iv) disjunction OFF (force singletons); (v) exact-table vs LLM-elicited-table (kinship); (vi) recall-floor gate ON vs OFF; (vii) ALTERNATIVE EDGE-READER (METRE-style multi-label head + a second LLM into the SAME closure pipeline -- recall-AND-rho-matched). BASELINES, EACH WITH A MATCHED ABSTENTION SIGNAL thresholded to the SAME coverage object: raw LLM (verbalized confidence), CoT, self-consistency (vote margin), LINC-style multi-formalization vote, DSR-LM-style induced-rule Prolog (no closure), Path-of-Thoughts (PRIMARY real-text baseline; path-agreement abstain), NAIVE single-pass intersection (iteration contrast), a TempRel-style COMMIT baseline, and a soft-unification neural theorem prover.

  METRICS, per-regime and STRATIFIED: (1) SINGLETON-RESOLUTION-TO-CORRECT yield + risk-coverage/selective accuracy AT MATCHED COVERAGE (HEADLINE H1) with paired-bootstrap adjusted CIs, reported alongside strict-tightening yield (stated non-load-bearing); (2) END-TO-END hallucination-rate reduction vs raw LLM on the deduction-required/absent-relation subset (HEADLINE H2) with a pre-registered minimum effect; (3) empirical zero-FP audit CONDITIONED on EMPIRICAL J(E) (reliability curve slope ~1; rho reported); (4) REDUNDANCY DECOMPOSITION (benefit vs silent-narrowing cost, located peak, gate shift) on SYNTHETIC + coarse REAL anchor; (5) full-minus-naive gap vs hop/cyclomatic on SYNTHETIC and the real >=3-edge/cyclic stratum; (6) Mode-B detection (lower bound on Allen IA/RCC-8, exact on the point-algebra arm) + repair quality; (7) reader-agnostic closure delta at matched recall and reported rho; (8) APPLICABILITY ENVELOPE -- relation-composable, multi-path-with-bite, deduction-required, AND >=3-edge/cyclic fractions per corpus (N* up front), scored against the pre-registered NUMBER; (9) atomic extraction P/R as a HELD-FIXED control; (10) the non-circularity audit (locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied fraction on NarrativeTime). Closure and repair run in milliseconds per network on a laptop.
success_criteria: |-
  THREE ARM-SCOPED HEADLINE PREDICTIONS (stated before all qualifiers; the confirmatory family H1-H4 is Holm-Bonferroni-adjusted, H1/H2 are gateways). CONFIRM lines: (REAL-TEXT) On the dense co-primary's deduction-required multi-path-with-bite subset at the pre-registered frontier operating point, Mode A achieves strictly higher SELECTIVE ACCURACY AT MATCHED COVERAGE than Path-of-Thoughts AND self-consistency (H1), AND cuts the CONFIDENT-WRONG (hallucination) rate versus a raw LLM on the same absent-relation pairs by at least the pre-registered minimum effect (H2) -- both adjusted-CI-separated from zero, driven by singleton-resolution-to-correct; Mode A is PREDICTED TO TIE naive single-pass intersection on the length-2 stratum and that tie is reported as confirmation, not failure. (ITERATION) FULL ITERATED closure beats NAIVE single-pass intersection with the gap GROWING in hop-count/cyclomatic number (and ~0 on length-2) on synthetic QCNs AND, where T0 found a usable real >=3-edge/cyclic stratum, on real text (H3). (REDUNDANCY) Net Mode-A gain is an INVERTED-U whose peak increases with recall and shifts outward under the recall-floor gate, at the pre-registered estimation precision (>=4 recall levels, >=500 networks/cell, >=1-bin minimum-detectable peak shift, peak bin CI-above both neighbors) (H4). Additionally CONFIRMS if: T0 reports N* clearing the applicability NUMBER on >=1 real corpus (NarrativeTime preferred, TDDMan corroborating) so the headline is genuine deduction not re-reading; the empirical zero-FP audit tracks J(E) (slope ~1, rho reported, slope-offset correctly attributed); the coarse real-text redundancy anchor matches the synthetic inverted-U sign; disjunction-ON beats commit-to-singleton; and the gain is reader-agnostic at matched recall+rho. DISCONFIRM lines: (REAL-TEXT) NEITHER a singleton-resolution advantage over PoT/voting NOR a hallucination-rate drop vs raw LLM exists on the deduction-required multi-path-with-bite subset even when sound sets are sub-universal and bite exists; (ITERATION) the full-minus-naive gap is ~0 even on multi-hop/cyclic queries (the win is 'any intersection,' not iteration); (REDUNDANCY) the SINGLE genuine disconfirmer -- the ABSENCE of any net-positive redundancy region beating BOTH best-single-path and naive-intersection (a flat/turned-over curve ALONE is NOT a disconfirmation); or T0 shows NO corpus clears the applicability NUMBER (then honestly scoped to synthetic + niche-safety-net).

  PRE-REGISTERED FAILURE MODES (each a publishable scope boundary): [NEAR-UNIVERSAL UNDER-SPECIFICATION | precondition: sets effectively universal | bound: Mode A inert, intersection cannot resolve singletons | the ONLY under-specification outcome that disconfirms Mode A]. [SILENT WRONG NARROWING | precondition: a contributing set OMITS gold (unsound) | bound: rate <= (1-recall) per-edge and (1 - J(E)) per-network | suppressed by the recall-floor gate, which also shifts the redundancy peak]. [CONSISTENT-BUT-WRONG ELICITED TABLE | precondition: LLM supplies the composition table | bound: quantified vs gold in kinship only | shown NOT to arise in exact-table settings]. [INVISIBLE SINGLE-CHAIN HALLUCINATION | precondition: confident self-consistent single chain | bound: closure cannot see it | scopes Mode B to multi-path collapse only]. [TINY/CIRCULAR ENVELOPE | precondition: N* below the applicability NUMBER even on the dense corpus, or gold purely-timeline-implied with no non-circular replication on TDDMan | bound: contribution scoped to synthetic + niche safety-net | decided a-priori by T0, not after spend]. Throughout, 'zero false-positive' is stated separately for Mode A (intersected set still contains gold under JOINT-sound inputs, audited against EMPIRICAL J(E)) and Mode B (DETECTION only); the closure-detectable hallucination rate is a LOWER BOUND because PC is incomplete for Allen IA/RCC-8 (complete only on the NarrativeTime start-point convex-point-algebra arm). Atomic extraction P/R must remain comparable to baselines, the per-corpus fractions (including a-priori N* and the >=3-edge/cyclic prevalence) must be reported up front, and trace-graphs must be judged human-auditable.

  NarrativeTime / TimeBankNT (Rogers et al., LREC-COLING 2024; arXiv:1908.11443): the FIRST timeline-based annotation achieving
  FULL coverage of all possible TLinks, a human re-annotation of TimeBank-Dense (news) with IAA Krippendorff alpha ~0.68 and
  significantly higher density, plus tools converting to TimeML. We USE it as the dense real-text CO-PRIMARY because (unlike
  MATRES) it has direct human gold for NON-LOCAL pairs and (unlike TimeBank-Dense) its dense relations are HUMAN-timeline-backed
  rather than SputLink-inferred. Difference from our work: NarrativeTime is a DATASET/annotation scheme producing a single
  consistent labeling for extraction evaluation; it neither preserves LLM disjunction, intersects compositions across paths,

  from existing annotations,' doubling TimeBank-Dense's links; relation set {before, after, simultaneous, includes, is_included},
  mutually exclusive, no VAGUE. We USE TDDMan as the NON-CIRCULARITY anchor: its gold is provably NOT the output of the closure
  algorithm we test, so a Mode-A narrowing win there cannot be a closure artifact. Difference: TDDiscourse is a benchmark
  for committed single-label discourse-level extraction; it preserves no disjunction, performs no cross-path intersection,

  it enforces consistency under the F1-maximizing COMMIT contract (which it shows fails); no closure-as-CERTIFICATE, no preserved
  disjunction, no abstention/risk-coverage, no cross-path zero-FP narrowing. We read its negative result as motivation to

  maximise F1 (not recall-oriented soundness); it carries no set through an EXACT composition table across MULTIPLE paths,
  performs no cross-path intersection, issues no certificate, does not abstain. We use it as an ALTERNATIVE EDGE-READER into
  the SAME closure pipeline (Tier-2) at MATCHED per-edge recall with reported rho, to show the cross-path-closure gain is

  labeling; SputLink computes closure to DENSIFY TimeBank. Differences: all COMMIT to one relation per pair for F1, use learned/approximate
  inference, and (for SputLink) produce the very non-adjacent gold whose circularity we AVOID by using NarrativeTime's direct
  human-timeline gold and TDDMan's manual non-auto-inferable gold; we PRESERVE disjunction, NARROW by exact-table cross-path

  composition rules to fit task accuracy. Difference: rule induction optimises data fit and gives a point answer; we enforce
  the EXACT ALGEBRAIC LAWS (converse, associativity, disjointness) necessary for soundness independent of training data, and

  vote margins, or RL with abstention-aware rewards. Difference: abstention is driven by GENERIC confidence/uncertainty signals
  or learned at the QA-answer level; there is no algebraic consistency certificate, no per-edge reading-error localisation,
  no preserved relation-algebra disjunction, and no closure-based narrowing. Ours abstains precisely because deductive closure
  leaves the query a disjunction -- a structural, training-free, per-edge certificate.

  ablation), Renz & Nebel (random network model A(n,d,l)), Vilain & Kautz 1986 (point algebra), Nebel & Burckert 1995 (ORD-Horn,
  JACM 42(1)). So PC is COMPLETE for the convex point algebra and ORD-Horn yet SOUND-BUT-INCOMPLETE for full Allen IA / RCC-8.
  Difference: these assume a clean human-given table on already-formal data; none read the algebra off NL via an LLM, certify
  reading errors, narrow by cross-path intersection of LLM disjunctions, model an EMPIRICALLY-audited recall-bounded redundancy
  OPTIMUM, or optimise risk-coverage.

  A Level-3 (methodological) cross-domain transfer from Qualitative Spatial-Temporal Reasoning and Tarski's relation algebras
  -- Allen's interval algebra, RCC-8, the convex point algebra, composition tables, and the path-consistency / algebraic-closure
  constraint-propagation algorithms (GQR/SparQ; Mackworth's iterated PC), plus the tractability theory (point-algebra and
  ORD-Horn completeness vs full-Allen NP-completeness) -- imported into LLM-based relational reasoning and hallucination control,
  with Reiter's 1980s model-based diagnosis (minimal hitting sets of conflict sets) for localising which extracted atom to
  retract. The Level-1 framing is CODING THEORY: an exact composition table turns multi-path redundancy in a document into
  an error-correcting code over LLM extractions -- redundant constraining paths let closure DETECT and CORRECT mis-reads with
  no external labels, as parity checks detect bit errors. The coding-theory 'optimal rate' sharpening (net benefit is an INVERTED-U
  because narrowing stays zero-FP only while every contributing symbol is sound) is made RIGOROUS: the joint-soundness 'decoding
  margin' is MEASURED empirically as J(E) rather than assumed as the independence product r^E, since a single LLM reader produces
  positively-correlated reading errors -- so the predicted peak uses the measured channel correlation. The Level-2 framing
  is SELECTIVE PREDICTION / risk-coverage in ML: compare an abstaining method against non-abstaining baselines at MATCHED
  COVERAGE with a shared coverage object and report the ACTIONABLE (singleton-resolution-to-correct) yield AND the downstream
  hallucination-rate reduction. Two refinements drive THIS iteration. (a) CORPUS SELECTION AS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: a mechanism's
  claim must live on a corpus that can structurally host it -- since MATRES annotates only adjacent-sentence pairs its deduction-required
  envelope is empty by construction, so the headline is relocated to a DENSE, full-coverage, direct-human-gold corpus (NarrativeTime)
  and corroborated where gold is provably non-closure-derived (TDDMan), with MATRES retained as a control that proves the
  gate discriminates. (b) ARM SCOPING borrowed from the discipline of stating where a mechanism's advantage must and must
  not appear: iterated closure provably equals a single intersection pass on acyclic length-2 structures, so the iteration
  win is claimed only on >=3-edge/cyclic structures -- now found on BOTH synthetic networks and the dense corpus's real long-hop
  stratum, dissolving the prior internal contradiction without confining the win to synthetic data. Three cross-field insights
  anchor the design: (1) LLMs are competent LOCAL qualitative namers that do NOT propagate constraints across paths -- the
  missing piece is global ITERATED propagation, and cross-path INTERSECTION of sound sets is a zero-FP win needing no over-commitment;
  (2) because the table is mathematical ground truth, intersection-of-sound-sets can only move toward gold and collapse-of-unsound-sets
  is a calibration-free certificate -- flipping the objective from accuracy-by-committing (ILP global inference, whose own
  results show consistency-enforcement does not raise F1) to faithfulness-by-abstaining; (3) the coding-theory lens names
  BOTH the safe primary mode (erasure-style narrowing) and the Achilles heel (a recall-bounded decoding radius whose EMPIRICAL
  joint-soundness decay produces an inverted-U), elevated to a pre-registered, decomposed, estimation-precision-bounded prediction
  anchored on both synthetic and real text.
terms:
- term: Dense direct-human-gold CO-PRIMARY (NarrativeTime / TimeBankNT)
  definition: >-
    The relocated real-text headline host: a timeline-based, FULL-TLink-coverage human re-annotation of TimeBank-Dense (news),
    IAA Krippendorff alpha ~0.68. Its density supplies abundant multi-path and >=3-edge/cyclic constraint structures (hosting
    both narrowing and a real-text iteration demonstration); its start-point restriction lands in the convex point algebra
    (PC COMPLETE); and its non-local gold is HUMAN-timeline-placed, not algorithmic-closure output, so closure recovery is
    non-circular. Replaces MATRES as primary because MATRES annotates only adjacent-sentence pairs.
- term: Gate-validation control (MATRES)
  definition: >-
    MATRES is retained but repositioned: because it annotates ONLY same/adjacent-sentence event pairs, every gold edge is
    locally co-occurring (directly-readable), so its deduction-required multi-path-with-bite envelope is structurally near-EMPTY
    and T0's N* ~ 0 by construction. Reporting this N* ~ 0 alongside NarrativeTime/TDDMan N* >> 0 demonstrates the deduction-required
    gate is DISCRIMINATIVE rather than vacuous.
- term: Non-circularity anchor (TDDMan)
  definition: >-
    The manually-annotated long-distance (>1-sentence-apart) subset of TDDiscourse whose pairs 'cannot be inferred automatically
    from existing annotations' -- so its gold is provably NOT the output of the closure algorithm under test. A Mode-A narrowing
    win on TDDMan therefore cannot be a closure artifact, bounding the residual timeline-implied-circularity worry about NarrativeTime
    by empirical replication rather than assertion. Relation set {before, after, simultaneous, includes, is_included}, coarse
    interval algebra.
- term: Non-circularity audit (locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied)
  definition: >-
    For NarrativeTime, a partition of held-out edges into LOCALLY-JUSTIFIABLE (a textual cue near both events that the local-only
    reader can exploit) versus PURELY-TIMELINE-IMPLIED (no local cue; gold obtainable only from the human's holistic timeline).
    The deduction-required headline subset is the latter; because its gold is human-timeline placement (not algorithmic PC),
    recovering it by closure over independently LLM-read edges uses a DIFFERENT inference process and is non-circular. The
    fraction is reported up front.
- term: End-to-end hallucination-reduction headline (H2)
  definition: >-
    Promoted from a Tier-2 echo to a co-headline because it is the umbrella pipeline's actual deliverable: on the deduction-required
    / absent-relation subset, the closure pipeline's CONFIDENT-WRONG (non-abstained gold-mismatch) rate is lower than a raw
    LLM forced to a single relation, by at least a PRE-REGISTERED minimum effect, adjusted-CI-separated. A gateway test of
    the confirmatory family.
- term: Real-text iteration stratum (H3 on real text)
  definition: >-
    The dense corpus's >=3-edge/cyclic constraint structures, whose prevalence T0 computes a-priori (zero LLM spend). Length-2
    real queries still tie naive intersection (as predicted), but on this stratum full ITERATED closure can beat naive single-pass
    intersection -- bringing part of the iteration win onto real text instead of confining it to synthetic networks. If the
    stratum is empty/tiny, the iteration claim honestly stays synthetic-only.
- term: Applicability-envelope threshold (concrete number)
  definition: >-
    The pre-registered NUMBER distinguishing a 'general mechanism' from a 'niche safety-net': the deduction-required multi-path-with-bite
    fraction of evaluable held-out edges is scored >=10% = general mechanism, 5-10% = useful module, <5% = niche safety-net.
    Fixed before any LLM spend and reported from T0, so the contribution's reach is declared, not argued post-hoc.
- term: Multiplicity policy (confirmatory vs exploratory)
  definition: >-
    A pre-registered stance against the garden-of-forking-paths objection: the CONFIRMATORY family is H1 (narrowing), H2 (hallucination
    reduction), H3 (iteration gap grows), H4 (redundancy inverted-U disconfirmer), tested with Holm-Bonferroni / hierarchical
    gatekeeping (H1/H2 gateways) and ADJUSTED CIs; all strata, per-bin curves, reader-agnosticity, Mode-B, and secondary corpora
    are EXPLORATORY with nominal CIs.
- term: Recall-and-rho-matched reader-agnosticity
  definition: >-
    The protocol for the alternative-edge-reader test: each reader (METRE-style trained multi-label head; a second LLM/prompt
    family) is tuned to a MATCHED per-edge recall AND its measured cross-edge error correlation rho is reported, with the
    agnosticity verdict interpreted conditional on BOTH (conditioning on rho if it differs materially). Prevents 'the win
    is in the algebra' from being confounded by a reader whose F1-oriented training gives the same recall but different error
    correlation.
- term: Empirical joint soundness J(E)
  definition: >-
    The realized fraction of E-edge constraining subnetworks in which ALL edges are sound, MEASURED directly from data, replacing
    the independence product prod_e r_e. The zero-FP audit's reliability curve is pre-registered against J(E); the inverted-U
    cost term is 1 - J(E); positive cross-edge correlation rho makes J(E) decay slower than r^E so the predicted peak sits
    further out than an independence model says.
- term: Sound narrowing (Mode A, primary)
  definition: >-
    The zero-false-positive value mode: when every contributing LLM edge set is SOUND (contains its gold relation) but sub-universal,
    intersecting the compositions arriving at a query pair from MULTIPLE non-universal paths yields a set that still contains
    gold yet is strictly tighter than any single path. Requires breadth + multi-path bite, NOT over-commitment; its zero-FP
    guarantee SURVIVES PC incompleteness; inert only in the degenerate all-universal limit.
- term: Singleton-resolution-to-correct yield (headline metric)
  definition: >-
    The load-bearing Mode-A metric: the fraction of multi-path SOUND-input query pairs whose cross-path intersection collapses
    the query to the single CORRECT relation. Distinguished from STRICT-TIGHTENING yield (any reduction), which does NOT move
    matched-coverage selective accuracy nor the hallucination-rate metric. Both reported; singleton-resolution is load-bearing.
- term: Inverted-U redundancy optimum
  definition: >-
    Net Mode-A selective-accuracy gain RISES then FALLS as path redundancy/hop-count increases at fixed per-edge recall: more
    paths add narrowing benefit, but each added contributing edge lowers empirical joint soundness J(E), so silent-narrowing
    cost (1 - J(E)) eventually dominates. Peak location increases with recall; the recall-floor gate shifts it outward. Established
    only at a pre-registered estimation precision; otherwise reported as 'directionally consistent.'
- term: Naive-intersection baseline
  definition: >-
    Intersect the compositions arriving at the query pair in a SINGLE pass, without iterating to a fixpoint and without algebra-seeded
    converse propagation -- i.e. 'Path-of-Thoughts plus one obvious intersection step.' It COINCIDES with full closure on
    length-2 multi-path queries (so Mode A is predicted to TIE it on the real-text length-2 stratum) but diverges on longer/cyclic
    networks, where the full-minus-naive gap GROWS -- the iteration claim, tested on synthetic AND the real >=3-edge/cyclic
    stratum.
- term: Detection/repair (Mode B, secondary)
  definition: >-
    The collapse-based value mode: an empty closure certifies that some LLM edge is UNSOUND -- a gold-free zero-FP DETECTION
    flag (conditional on recall). Requires at least one over-committed/recall-failed edge to fire, supports Reiter-style minimal-hitting-set
    localisation/repair (which can mislocalise), and carries the silent-wrong-narrowing dual. Reported distinctly from Mode
    A; magnitude tracks the measured over-commitment rate.
- term: Recall-bite frontier
  definition: >-
    The curve, traced by sweeping the prompt-elicited breadth knob from 'name the relation' to 'name the maximal sound set,'
    of per-edge recall against singleton-resolution-to-correct yield and collapse rate. Recall and bite are in direct tension
    on the SAME knob, so a single operating point cannot establish viability; we map the frontier and pre-register that the
    main run proceeds only if a region clears a recall gate AND yields non-trivial singleton-resolution-to-correct.
- term: Deduction-required vs directly-readable stratification
  definition: >-
    A LOCAL-ONLY READER probe predicts each held-out edge from ONLY the minimal local span(s) where its two events co-occur
    (or flags 'no shared span'). Edges it confidently and correctly names are DIRECTLY-READABLE; the rest are DEDUCTION-REQUIRED
    (obtainable only by composing >=2 edges). We foreground the deduction-required fraction, stratify the headline by it,
    and draw the primary subset preferentially from deduction-required triangles. The T0 gate uses a structural proxy (no
    shared local span) computable without the LLM.
- term: Convex point algebra (NarrativeTime start-point arm)
  definition: >-
    The relation algebra over a single time point per event with convex base relations <=, =, >= (and disjunctions). NarrativeTime's
    timeline yields start-points whose ordering instantiates this algebra, for which path-consistency is provably COMPLETE
    and the table exact. We widen non-convex {<,>} (genuine !=) to VAGUE to preserve completeness and MEASURE the bite lost;
    if non-trivial we add a full-interval Allen arm scored as a lower-bound detector.
- term: Silent wrong narrowing (pre-registered failure mode)
  definition: >-
    When a contributing set OMITS gold (unsound), closure can narrow the query to a confident WRONG singleton with NO empty
    collapse -- a certified-LOOKING hallucination the mechanism actively endorses. Its rate is bounded per-edge by (1-recall)
    and per-network by (1 - J(E)); reported in the decomposition of gold-wrong non-abstained predictions; the recall-floor
    gate is tested as a mitigation and as the lever that shifts the inverted-U redundancy peak.
- term: Matched-coverage selective comparison
  definition: >-
    The protocol for comparing an abstaining method against baselines: each baseline is given its own abstention/confidence
    signal (vote margin, verbalised confidence, vote agreement, path-agreement), thresholds are swept so every method reports
    at the SAME coverage using the SAME coverage object (single-relation resolution), and selective accuracy is compared with
    paired-bootstrap CIs -- preventing the headline from conflating 'closure' with 'closure has a better-calibrated abstain.'
- term: Trace-graph
  definition: >-
    A human-auditable record: the QCN, which composition entries fired on which paths during closure, any minimal repairs,
    and optionally an equivalent SWI-Prolog/ASP proof discharged from the closed table for replay -- the connective tissue
    to the umbrella text-to-logic pipeline's auditability and quantified-hallucination-reduction requirements.
summary: >-
  We import exact relation-algebra path consistency (Allen interval, convex point algebra, RCC-8) into the deduction module
  of a text-to-logic pipeline and -- fixing the prior version's fatal corpus choice -- relocate the real-text headline from
  MATRES (adjacent-sentence-only, deduction-required envelope empty by construction) to a DENSE direct-human-gold corpus (NarrativeTime,
  full TLink coverage, human-timeline gold), corroborated on TDDMan whose gold is provably non-closure-derived: cross-path
  SOUND NARROWING of the LLM's high-recall disjunctive sets beats path-isolated reasoning and voting at matched coverage AND
  cuts the hallucination rate versus a raw LLM, while iterated closure beats naive single-pass intersection on long-hop/cyclic
  structures both synthetic AND real, and the recall-bounded inverted-U redundancy optimum is audited via empirical joint
  soundness J(E). An a-priori, zero-LLM-spend envelope gate (with a concrete applicability threshold), a confirmatory-vs-exploratory
  multiplicity policy, and recall-and-rho-matched reader-agnosticity make every headline falsifiable before any model is called.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same closure frame; split into transferable composition+certificate vs synthetic-only intersection-coding mechanism
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Adopted the reviewer's evidence boundary as the organizing principle: split the contribution into TRANSFERABLE (inherited
  exact-table composition + gold-free abstain-on-collapse certificate, confirmed at power on CLUTRR + temporal) vs SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL-ONLY
  (the cross-path-intersection error-correcting-code mechanism); retired the 'real-text advantage confirmed / two non-synthetic
  venues' framing (reviewer evidence + scope MAJORs).
- >-
  RECAST the novel coding/intersection mechanism as synthetic-only and explicitly NOT-retired: CLUTRR uses a single-chain
  UNION fixpoint (PC-2 intersection is unsound on kinship; no redundant constraining paths), and the temporal iteration signature
  is NS at power (full-vs-naive +0.027 p=0.079; >=3-edge/cyclic +0.042 p=0.061) (reviewer evidence MAJOR).
- >-
  Made the DECISIVE iter-4 experiment explicit: identify/construct real-text deduction queries with genuine multi-path redundancy
  (>=2 disjoint, non-transitively-trivial constraining paths) and show cross-path intersection narrows beyond single-path
  composition at power; else label the coding result synthetic-only.
- >-
  Dropped the CLUTRR overclaim: re-described it as a TEMPLATED/semi-synthetic kinship benchmark (max 871 chars, gold surface
  forms, hand-supplied table => no LLM fuzzy-unification/implicit composition); only the temporal corpora are natural text,
  and there the contribution is marginal (reviewer scope MAJOR).
- >-
  Foregrounded the deduction-sub-module scope AND the ~0.53-atomic-recall ceiling (=> ~19% Mode-A coverage) in title/abstract/intro;
  stated OpenCyc grounding and LLM fuzzy-unification out of scope; suggested re-titling to center the sub-module (reviewer
  scope MAJOR).
- >-
  Added the new honest finding that the certificate is WEAKLY PROTECTIVE on natural temporal text (42.5% confident-wrong among
  answered; raw out-accuracies Mode-A by 0.124) and tempered 'faithfulness-by-abstention'; tied it to the undetectable silent-wrong-narrowing
  mode (reviewer evidence MINOR).
- >-
  Added reporting-rigor fixes: bootstrap CI must bracket the observed gap (temporal H1 CI [0.045,0.315] excludes +0.0265);
  CLUTRR naive must report natural-coverage selective accuracy + flag force-extension; route the iteration claim through the
  coverage axis (reviewer rigor MINOR).
- >-
  Sharpened the one-sentence novelty to the training-free/per-edge/gold-free abstain-on-collapse certificate uniquely demonstrated
  end-to-end, separated from the synthetic-only coding-rate thesis; added GDLLM (2508.20828) and BeDiscovER (2511.13095) (reviewer
  novelty MINOR).
- >-
  Preserved confirmed results but re-tagged each by evidence class and where it holds: decomposition (+0.673 inherited / +0.0025
  novel selacc), algebra-richness scaling (point->RCC-8->Allen), synthetic inverted-U (Page p~5e-4 corrected from 1e-13),
  zero-FP theorem, corpus-specific read-soundness at n~160.
- >-
  Added an OPTIONAL minimal LLM-fuzzy-unification stretch (fill one undefined composition cell) to touch the project-goal
  gap without overclaiming; downgraded overall confidence because the load-bearing novel mechanism's real-text transfer came
  back negative at power.

  Retire reviewer MINOR #6 (incomplete positioning) by pinning the two nearest non-matching neighbors with verified BibTeX
  and a sharpened one-sentence novelty, AND de-risk the spatial venue by verifying the spatial corpora and exact spatial-algebra
  composition tables next iteration's decisive spatial experiment will need.
approach: >-
  Build on the iter-3 citation bundle [ARTIFACT:art_fFOG-OJakRw-] using aii-web-tools (search -> fetch -> fetch_grep) + aii-semscholar-bib.
  (1) CITATIONS: confirm GDLLM (arXiv:2508.20828) and BeDiscovER (arXiv:2511.13095) resolve to real papers (find correct replacements
  if not), fetch verified BibTeX, and extract each one's objective + output contract (single-label COMMIT? abductive REPAIR?
  trained/learned abstention?). Deliver a crisp differentiation: our contribution PRESERVES a relation-algebra disjunction
  and ABSTAINS on closure-collapse (gold-free, training-free, per-edge certificate) versus their commit/repair/trained objectives.
  Sharpen the paper's one-sentence novelty to exactly what is uniquely demonstrated end-to-end on a real benchmark (the training-free,
  per-edge, gold-free abstain-on-collapse certificate over LLM-extracted relational facts), SEPARATED CLEANLY from the cross-path-intersection
  coding-rate thesis (whose real-text status this iteration's decisive experiment determines). (2) SPATIAL DOSSIER (for the
  sibling spatial DATASET this iter and the spatial EXPERIMENT next iter): verify SpartQA (Human + Auto), ReSQ, StepGame,
  and SpaRTUN/SpaRP -- availability (HF/repo), license, relation vocabulary, document length, and whether scenes contain MULTI-PATH
  redundancy (multiple objects -> multiple edge-disjoint constraining paths between a query pair). Identify and source the
  EXACT composition tables for the relevant spatial algebras: the cardinal-direction calculus (Frank 1996 / Ligozat 1998 --
  9 single-tile direction relations + its composition table) for directional relations, and confirm the already-validated
  RCC-8 table for mereotopological relations, flagging any cells needing self-test in the next-iter engine extension. Deliver
  research_out.json with verified BibTeX, per-paper objective summaries, the differentiation paragraph + sharpened novelty
  sentence, ID corrections if any, the spatial-corpus comparison table, and the spatial-algebra composition-table sources.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for research artifacts:
  - cpu_light: 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM — proofs, research, lightweight tasks (fallback: memory-optimized CPUs first (cpu3m → cpu5m), then GPU hosts last-ditch)

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-06-17 20:14:41 UTC

```
### Goal

Develop an operational translation pipeline that converts unstructured textual content (e.g., short legal documents, news articles, kids' stories) into a formal first-order logic representation. The output must be capable of (probabilistic) reasoning using a logic reasoner (like Prolog), leveraging LLMs to dynamically resolve terminology, concepts, and relations that are not well defined in the explicit text.

### Reviewer Scope

Limit the technical core to areas the reviewer can deeply evaluate. Other fields are welcome for inspiration but should not host the substantive contribution.

Reviewer-evaluable areas: semantic technologies, logic programming, inductive logic programming, information retrieval, machine learning, LLMs, deep learning, knowledge extraction, knowledge graphs, reasoning, and text data analytics.

The pipeline should ingest a short document (approx. 3000 characters) and parse it into a structured, computable format. Methods may combine an LLM acting as a semantic translation engine (mapping natural text to first-order logic or Prolog predicates), a running logic interpreter (like SWI-Prolog) for symbolic execution, and the integration of upper ontologies like OpenCyc to supply necessary background structure and taxonomic grounding. Furthermore, an LLM should be deployed as a probabilistic reasoning engine to handle fuzzy unifications, semantic similarities, and logical gaps where strict symbolic matching fails due to language ambiguity.

Evaluation must be rigorous and compare the neuro-symbolic pipeline against purely neural baselines (e.g., standard RAG, chain-of-thought prompting) on standard logical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., RuleTaker, CLUTRR) or custom annotated datasets. It must specifically measure:
(i) the precision and recall of atomic fact extraction directly from the original document, and
(ii) the accuracy of multi-hop fact extraction and logical deductions that require synthesizing explicit document facts with implicit common-sense knowledge.

Outputs must provide human-auditable trace-graphs of the reasoning steps to clearly demonstrate the logical path taken.

Constraints: The pipeline must be highly reproducible on any short, professionally written documents. Inference must be executable on commodity hardware, and the system must report a quantified reduction in hallucination rates compared to raw LLM generation.

### Publication

Target ACL Knowledge Extraction track as the primary venue, with EMNLP or specialized neuro-symbolic AI conference tracks (e.g., NeSy) as fallback targets.

### Things to Avoid

Avoid simplistic propositional logic translations of the text. Avoid purely neural black-box systems that lack interpretable reasoning traces. The substantive contribution must be an operational, hybrid method for reasoning with textual content that explicitly minimizes hallucinations.
