You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.

<research_methodology>
Write like a researcher drafting a paper, not a chatbot summarizing bullet points.

- Structure as a paper would: research question → methodology → results → analysis → limitations. Not a list of "we did X, then Y."
- Ground every claim in specific artifacts and specific numbers. "Results show improvement" is empty — state effect sizes, baselines, and conditions.
- Be honest about what worked, what didn't, and why. Don't spin failures as "future work."

Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).

# Introduction

A growing class of systems aims to read a short, professionally written document -- a news report, a contract clause, a children's story -- into a formal representation (first-order logic predicates, Prolog facts) that a symbolic reasoner can execute, optionally grounded against an upper ontology, with a large language model (LLM) resolving the terminology, concepts, and relations that the surface text leaves implicit. Such a pipeline promises auditable, replayable reasoning over text, but it has a structurally identifiable weak link. Atomic extraction -- naming the entities and the relations that hold between locally co-occurring mentions -- is by now something LLMs do competently. The \emph{deduction} step is where faithfulness breaks: synthesizing the explicitly stated facts with implicit composition knowledge to answer a query about a pair of entities that never co-occur in any single span. This is the multi-hop relational reasoning the user ultimately cares about, and it is exactly where hallucination is most damaging and hardest to detect.

Faithful multi-hop relational reasoning over text matters wherever the cost of a confidently wrong answer is high: ordering the events in a news story, tracking kinship in a narrative, resolving containment and region relations in a description, chaining clauses in a legal document. The relations involved -- temporal order, kinship, spatial containment -- are precisely the ones for which mathematics has supplied exact \emph{composition laws} for forty years: Allen's interval algebra \citep{Allen1983}, the convex point algebra \citep{Vilain1986}, the region connection calculus RCC-8 \citep{Randell1992}, and the path-consistency constraint-propagation algorithms that operate over them \citep{Mackworth1977}. If a document says event $A$ is before $B$ and $B$ is before $C$, the relation between $A$ and $C$ is not a matter of opinion to be guessed; it is determined by an exact table. The opportunity is to make an LLM-driven pipeline reason with these laws rather than around them.

The deduction step is hard because the obvious ways of using an LLM all fail in characteristic ways. Composing freely, the LLM is locally fluent but globally inconsistent: it can assign more than one temporal relation to the same pair and violate transitivity, producing silent errors that an answer-level vote \citep{Wang2022} or a solver-crash signal \citep{Pan2023} cannot see. Reasoning each path in isolation -- the strategy of backward chaining \citep{Kazemi2022} and Path-of-Thoughts \citep{Zhang2024} -- deliberately avoids the global check, so it can neither tighten a disjunctive query by intersecting evidence from multiple paths nor detect a contradiction arriving at the same pair from two routes. Hand-crafting composition rules (the kinship rules behind CLUTRR \citep{Sinha2019}) does not scale, and inducing rules to fit task accuracy \citep{Zhang2023, Zhu2023} optimizes data fit rather than the algebraic laws needed for soundness.

Why has this not been solved? Because the entire recent lineage attacks it under the wrong output contract. A 2024 study of zero-shot temporal extraction finds LLMs assign multiple relations to over half (up to $97\%$) of pairs and violate transitivity, then enforces consistency with integer linear programming (ILP) and reports that consistency-enforcement \emph{does not improve} F1 \citep{Kougia2024}; the most recent global temporal-graph generator (EMNLP 2025) still aggregates generations and commits to a single label per pair via ILP, preserving no disjunction, issuing no certificate, and offering no abstention \citep{Eirew2025}. Classical temporal closure (SputLink densifies TimeBank \citep{Verhagen2005}; CAEVO does global inference by cascaded sieves \citep{Chambers2014}; structured learning enforces transitivity \citep{Ning2017}) likewise commits to one consistent labeling to maximize F1. We read this as evidence that consistency-enforcement under the F1-maximizing \emph{commit} contract is the wrong objective. The LLM's native multi-relation output is not noise to be collapsed; it is a \emph{sound disjunction} to be preserved and narrowed, and the right objective is faithfulness-by-abstention, not extraction F1.

Our approach inverts the contract. The LLM emits, per text span, a high-recall disjunctive set of base relations the span does not exclude. Because the composition tables are exact ground truth, intersecting the disjunctive sets arriving at a query pair from multiple constraining paths -- via iterated path consistency -- can only move toward the gold relation (Mode~A, a zero-false-positive narrowing that needs no over-commitment and no labels), while an empty intersection certifies that some read was unsound (Mode~B, a gold-free reading-error flag). Multi-path redundancy in a document thereby becomes an \emph{error-correcting code} over LLM extractions. The coding-theory lens predicts an optimal rate: narrowing stays zero-FP only while every contributing read is sound, and that joint probability decays as redundancy grows, so net benefit is an inverted-U whose peak we predict from the measured per-edge recall and the measured cross-edge error correlation. We validate the full mechanism on clean synthetic ground truth, contribute a zero-LLM-spend \emph{envelope gate} that decides a-priori where the mechanism can apply to real text, and -- our most decision-relevant result -- map a \emph{recall-bite frontier} that localizes the true bottleneck. The module runs in milliseconds on commodity hardware and emits human-auditable trace-graphs, directly serving the auditability and quantified-hallucination-reduction requirements of the surrounding text-to-logic pipeline.

[FIGURE:fig1]

## Summary of Contributions

- \textbf{An inverted output contract for the deduction module} (Section~3): preserve the LLM's disjunctive reading, narrow by exact-table cross-path intersection (Mode~A, zero-FP), certify reading errors by closure collapse (Mode~B), and abstain when deduction leaves a disjunction -- training-free, label-free, and auditable, in contrast to the F1-commit contract of all prior closure-over-extraction work \citep{Kougia2024, Eirew2025, Verhagen2005}.
- \textbf{A validated mechanism on clean ground truth} (Section~5.2): on 35{,}100 consistent-by-construction networks, \emph{iterated} closure error-corrects (full-minus-naive gap grows from $0.0$ at hop~2 to $0.99$ at hop~6, Page $p\approx10^{-13}$), net gain is a recall-dependent inverted-U ($K^\ast=2,4,5,5,8$ for recall $0.5\to0.95$), and the certificate is exactly zero-FP (all-sound $\Rightarrow$ gold-in-output probability $1.0$; silent-wrong rate $5.8\%$).
- \textbf{A zero-LLM-spend envelope gate} (Section~5.1): from gold graphs alone we compute, per corpus, the deduction-required, multi-path, bite-retaining, singleton-resolving count $N^\ast$ and a power calculation. The gate is discriminative -- MATRES yields $N^\ast{=}0$ (adjacent-sentence gold), NarrativeTime yields $N^\ast{=}25{,}450$ (applicability $0.88$) -- and costs nothing to run.
- \textbf{A recall-bite frontier that localizes the bottleneck} (Section~5.3): the binding constraint on real news text is LLM read-soundness, not the closure step. A cheap reader reaches per-edge recall $0.57$--$0.86$ across real arms (below the $0.85$/$0.90$ gates), while on clean text (recall $0.96$) closure resolves $42\%$ of deduction-required queries correctly. We report this as the pre-registered scope boundary it is, and show closure $\approx$ direct read when both use full document context, redirecting effort toward read-soundness and local-reader settings.

# Related Work

\textbf{Qualitative reasoning and tractability.} Allen's interval algebra \citep{Allen1983}, the convex point algebra \citep{Vilain1986}, and RCC-8 \citep{Randell1992} supply exact composition tables; Mackworth's path consistency \citep{Mackworth1977} iterates length-2 intersections to a fixpoint. Tractability is well charted: path consistency is \emph{complete} for the convex point algebra and the ORD-Horn fragment \citep{Nebel1994} but only \emph{sound-but-incomplete} for full Allen IA and RCC-8 \citep{Renz1999}. These frameworks assume a clean, human-given table on already-formal data; none read the algebra off natural language via an LLM, certify reading errors, narrow by intersecting LLM disjunctions, or model a recall-bounded redundancy optimum. We import the algorithms and inherit the tractability facts (our point-algebra arm is exact; Allen/RCC-8 collapse rates are lower bounds).

\textbf{Closure over machine-extracted temporal relations.} SputLink computes temporal closure to densify TimeBank annotations \citep{Verhagen2005}; CAEVO performs global temporal inference by cascaded sieves \citep{Chambers2014}; structured learning enforces transitivity for extraction \citep{Ning2017}. All commit to a single globally consistent labeling to maximize F1, preserve no disjunction, certify no reading error, and do not abstain. Critically, SputLink-style closure \emph{produces} the non-adjacent gold whose circularity we must avoid; we therefore evaluate against direct human-timeline gold \citep{Rogers2019} and manual long-distance gold \citep{Naik2019}.

\textbf{Consistency enforcement under the commit contract.} A zero-shot temporal study reports LLMs assign multiple relations to $50$--$97\%$ of pairs and that ILP consistency-enforcement does not raise F1 \citep{Kougia2024}; the most recent global temporal-graph generator still ILP-commits to one label per pair \citep{Eirew2025}. METRE trains a multi-label head to model temporal-relation ambiguity \citep{Hu2024} but is F1-trained, carries no set through a composition table across multiple paths, and does not abstain -- we use it conceptually as the alternative-reader contrast that future work plugs into the same closure pipeline at matched recall. LOCO-LMs fine-tune for propositional consistency at training time \citep{Calanzone2024}; we are training-free, at inference time, over a relation algebra.

\textbf{LLM reasoning, formalization, and abstention.} Chain-of-thought \citep{Wei2022} and self-consistency \citep{Wang2022} operate at the answer level and cannot see that individually popular composition steps are jointly inconsistent. Logic-LM self-refines on solver crashes \citep{Pan2023} and LINC majority-votes formalizations \citep{Olausson2023}, but neither maintains a positive global invariant over relational knowledge. Path-of-Thoughts reasons each extracted path independently \citep{Zhang2024}, beating prior methods on multi-hop spatial and kinship benchmarks \citep{Shi2022, Sinha2019} -- precisely the cross-path intersection gap Mode~A fills -- and rule-induction methods \citep{Zhang2023, Zhu2023} fit rules to data rather than enforcing algebraic law. Selective prediction \citep{Geifman2017} abstains on generic uncertainty; our abstention is structural, triggered when deductive closure leaves a disjunction. RuleTaker \citep{Clark2020} targets propositional entailment, an out-of-scope contrast to our relational composition. Reiter's model-based diagnosis \citep{Reiter1986} supplies the minimal-hitting-set machinery for the Mode-B repair we scope as future work. Hallucination in generation is a broad concern \citep{Ji2022}; our contribution is a per-edge, certificate-backed reduction rather than a generic confidence filter.

# Method

## Overview and the inverted output contract

The deduction module sits downstream of atomic extraction: it receives, for each pair of mentions that co-occur in a span, the relation the text licenses, and it must answer queries about pairs that do \emph{not} co-occur. We model the relations as a Qualitative Constraint Network (QCN): nodes are events/entities, and each edge carries a \emph{set} of base relations from a relation algebra $\mathcal{A}$ (the disjunction of relations not excluded by the evidence). The query (held-out) edge starts at the universal set. Three design commitments define the contract.

First, the LLM is a \emph{disjunctive, high-recall reader}: for each span it emits the maximal sound set of base relations the text does not exclude, with an explicit universal/underdetermined option, rather than committing to one relation. Soundness of an edge means its set contains the gold relation; recall is $P(\text{gold} \in \text{emitted set})$. Second, composition and converse come from the \emph{exact published table} of $\mathcal{A}$, never from the LLM. Third, the system narrows by closure and \emph{abstains} when the query edge remains a non-singleton.

## Two modes of value

\textbf{Mode~A (sound narrowing, primary).} When every contributing edge set is sound but sub-universal, intersecting the compositions arriving at the query pair from multiple paths yields a set that still contains gold yet is strictly tighter than any single path. The load-bearing metric is the \emph{singleton-resolution-to-correct} yield: the fraction of multi-path queries whose intersection collapses to the single correct relation (only this moves selective accuracy and the hallucination rate; strict-tightening is reported separately and is non-load-bearing). Mode~A requires only sub-universal breadth and multi-path bite; it does not require over-commitment, and its zero-FP guarantee survives path-consistency incompleteness because \emph{the intersection of sound sets is always sound}.

\textbf{Mode~B (detection/repair, secondary).} An empty closure is a deductive certificate that some edge is unsound, with no gold labels. It fires only when at least one over-committed or recall-failed edge is present, and it carries a pre-registered dual -- \emph{silent wrong narrowing}: an unsound set that \emph{omits} gold can drive closure to a confident wrong singleton with no collapse. We bound this per-edge by $(1-\text{recall})$ and per-network by $(1-J(E))$, where $J(E)$ is the empirical joint soundness defined below.

## Iterated closure versus naive intersection

We instrument three closure variants in one pipeline [ARTIFACT:art_K7riobQ_Rmwz]. \textsc{Full} is iterated Mackworth PC-2 run to a fixpoint with algebra-seeded converse propagation (our method). \textsc{Naive} intersects the compositions arriving at the query pair in a single pass, without iterating and without converse seeding -- i.e. Path-of-Thoughts plus one obvious intersection step. \textsc{Off} performs no propagation. A theorem we exploit and verify: on length-2 multi-path queries \textsc{Naive} equals \textsc{Full}; they diverge only on networks with $\geq 3$-edge paths or cyclomatic structure, where iterated propagation reaches tight-edge anchors a single pass cannot. The full-minus-naive gap is therefore the signature of \emph{iteration}, isolating our claim from "any intersection helps."

## Redundancy as a coding rate: the empirical inverted-U

Because Mode~A's zero-FP property holds only when all contributing edges are sound, and a single LLM reading one document produces positively correlated errors, we do not assume independent per-edge soundness. Instead of the product $\prod_e r_e$ we \emph{measure} the empirical joint soundness $J(E)$ = the realized fraction of $E$-edge constraining subnetworks in which all edges are sound, and we report the within-document cross-edge error correlation $\rho$. The inverted-U cost term is $1-J(E)$; positive $\rho$ makes $J(E)$ decay slower than $r^E$, so the predicted peak sits further out than an independence model says. Net gain rises while marginal narrowing dominates, then falls once silent-narrowing cost dominates -- an error-correcting code's optimal rate with the decoding radius set by recall and the channel correlation measured, not assumed.

## The a-priori envelope gate (T0)

Before spending any LLM budget, we compute from each gold graph \emph{alone} a four-stage funnel over held-out edges [ARTIFACT:art_K7riobQ_Rmwz]: (i) a structural deduction-required proxy (the two events share no local/adjacent span, i.e. sentence distance $> 1$); (ii) constrained by $\geq 2$ paths through distinct intermediates; (iii) a non-universal composition that retains bite after non-convex widening; (iv) cross-path intersection equal to the gold singleton ($N^\ast$). We also report the $\geq 3$-edge/cyclic prevalence (the real-text iteration envelope), the widening-induced bite loss, and a paired-bootstrap power calculation. The applicability threshold is pre-registered as a number: deduction-required-multi-path-with-bite fraction $\geq 10\%$ = general mechanism, $5$--$10\%$ = useful module, $<5\%$ = niche safety-net. The expected outcome -- MATRES $N^\ast\!\approx\!0$ (adjacent-sentence gold) versus a dense timeline $N^\ast \gg 0$ -- is itself a reported result validating the gate as discriminative rather than vacuous.

## Datasets, baselines, and metrics

\textbf{Real corpora} [ARTIFACT:art_PNrS9T8JeATf]. The dense co-primary is \emph{NarrativeTime}, a timeline-based, full-TLink-coverage human re-annotation of TimeBank-Dense \citep{Cassidy2014} (36 docs, 1{,}715 events, dense gold) \citep{Rogers2019}; its start-points instantiate the convex point algebra (path consistency complete, table exact), and its non-local gold is human-timeline-placed rather than algorithmic-closure output. Our build reproduces the shipped TLINKs exactly (a blocking gate over 207{,}496 relation-multisets), so the gold is non-circular. \emph{TDDMan} (TDDiscourse) supplies manually annotated long-distance ($>1$-sentence-apart) pairs that "cannot be inferred automatically from existing annotations" \citep{Naik2019} -- a structurally non-circular anchor. \emph{MATRES} \citep{Ning2018} annotates only same/adjacent-sentence pairs and serves as the gate-validation control.

\textbf{Synthetic backbone} [ARTIFACT:art_ghVQmxVlmOJJ]. 35{,}100 globally-consistent QCNs over the convex point and Allen algebras (primary) and RCC-8 (secondary), generated by model-based realization so the gold atomic relation on every edge is exact and the network is consistent by construction. Redundancy $P$, hop length $L$, and cyclomatic number $\mu$ are swept independently; a correctness gate (composition along every enumerated path contains the gold query relation) passes on all 35{,}100 networks.

\textbf{Baselines}, each given a matched abstention signal thresholded to the same coverage object (single-relation resolution): a raw LLM (verbalized confidence), chain-of-thought \citep{Wei2022}, self-consistency \citep{Wang2022}, LINC-style multi-formalization voting \citep{Olausson2023}, Path-of-Thoughts with path-agreement abstention \citep{Zhang2024}, the ILP-commit contract \citep{Eirew2025}, and \textsc{Naive} single-pass intersection (the iteration contrast); verified composition/converse tables, baseline configurations, and the corrected provenance of the consistency-no-F1-gain result \citep{Kougia2024} are drawn from an implementation dossier [ARTIFACT:art_aQ2Rf8rwqteI]. \textbf{Metrics}: singleton-resolution-to-correct and selective accuracy at matched coverage (headline), end-to-end confident-wrong (hallucination) rate, the zero-FP audit conditioned on $J(E)$, the full-minus-naive gap versus hop/cyclomatic structure, applicability $N^\ast$, and per-edge recall.

# Experimental Setup

We pre-registered a tiered plan that the artifacts execute in order. \textbf{T0} (zero LLM spend) is the envelope gate [ARTIFACT:art_K7riobQ_Rmwz]. \textbf{Tier-1 synthetic} de-risks the three mechanism claims on clean ground truth at full scale (600 networks/cell, 378 cells, 2{,}000 bootstrap resamples) [ARTIFACT:art_TV5eEjdDP-Xp]. The \textbf{recall-bite frontier pilot} sweeps a five-setting breadth knob on real corpora plus a synthetic battery and applies a pre-registered go/no-go [ARTIFACT:art_glhgFsBUrcYo]. The reading model is \texttt{google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite} at temperature 0 with a SHA-256 disk cache and a hard cost guard; total LLM spend was \$0.58 over the pilot's life and \$0 on the cached re-run. The QCN engine is bitmask-encoded and validated by a gating test suite: the Allen 169-cell table matches the published cells and the composition-converse law (0 failures), convex point completeness is confirmed against brute force (0 mismatches over 200 networks), and the iteration-isolation unit test confirms \textsc{Full}$=$\textsc{Naive} on a length-2 query and \textsc{Full}$\neq$\textsc{Naive} on a 3-hop chain [ARTIFACT:art_K7riobQ_Rmwz]. All synthetic results are fully deterministic; closure runs in $\sim$60s on 4 cores per experiment.

# Results

## The a-priori gate is discriminative and locates the structure

The T0 gate, run over three real corpora at zero LLM cost (59.6s total), behaves exactly as the design predicted [ARTIFACT:art_K7riobQ_Rmwz]. MATRES, whose gold is entirely same/adjacent-sentence, yields $N^\ast = 0$ (applicability $0.0$, niche band): the deduction-required gate correctly reports that there is nothing to deduce, confirming the gate is discriminative rather than vacuous. The dense NarrativeTime timeline yields $N^\ast = 25{,}450$ on its point-algebra arm out of 28{,}840 evaluable held-out edges -- applicability $0.882$, the \emph{general-mechanism} band -- recovered \emph{exactly} (the point algebra is complete), with $88.6\%$ of edges purely-timeline-implied (non-circular) and paired-bootstrap power $0.96$ at the pre-registered minimum effect $0.10$ (true-$N$ MDE $0.05$). TDDMan, the non-circular manual long-distance anchor, lands in the \emph{module} band (applicability $0.085$; $N^\ast = 408$ on the Allen arm, a sound lower bound), power $0.95$.

[FIGURE:fig5]

A subtler arm-scoping result emerges from the same gate. On NarrativeTime the iterated-PC advantage over single-pass is \emph{zero} (\texttt{full\_only}$=0$): the dense timeline is near-transitively closed, so a single intersection pass already has direct evidence for almost every query. The genuine iteration advantage appears only on \emph{sparse} long-hop gold: TDDMan exhibits 12 held-out edges that \textsc{Full} resolves but \textsc{Naive} cannot (\texttt{full\_only}$=12$; $408$ vs.\ $396$ resolved). This matches the theory -- iteration pays only on $\geq 3$-edge/cyclic structure -- and tells us the iteration claim must be demonstrated on sparse or synthetic long-hop networks, not dense timelines. The gate thus delivered its purpose: a GO on NarrativeTime for narrowing, with iteration scoped to TDDMan and synthetic data, all decided before any LLM spend.

## The mechanism works on clean ground truth: iteration, the inverted-U, and a zero-FP certificate

On the synthetic backbone, all three mechanism claims pass at full scale [ARTIFACT:art_TV5eEjdDP-Xp].

\textbf{Iteration error-corrects (H3).} The full-minus-naive selective-accuracy gap is a structural $0.0$ at hop length $L=2$ (95\% CI $[-0.047, 0.048]$, includes zero -- the predicted tie), then grows monotonically with chain length to $0.888$ at $L=3$, $0.955$ at $L=4$, $0.970$ at $L=5$, and $0.988$ at $L=6$ (Page trend $p\approx1.2\times10^{-4}$; Jonckheere $z=17.2$, $p\approx0$). The gap also rises with cyclomatic number, from $0.727$ at zero chords to $0.865$ at three. \textsc{Naive} resolves essentially nothing beyond $L=2$ ($\text{acc}=0.0$ for $L\geq3$), confirming that the contribution is specifically \emph{iterated} fixpoint propagation, not a single intersection.

[FIGURE:fig3]

\textbf{Redundancy is a recall-dependent inverted-U (H4).} The Mode-A resolution rate is an inverted-U in path redundancy $K$, and the optimum moves outward with per-edge recall: peak $K^\ast = 2, 4, 5, 5, 8$ as recall ranges over $0.5, 0.6, 0.75, 0.9, 0.95$. Under positive cross-edge correlation $\rho$, the measured joint soundness $J(E)$ exceeds the independence model $r^E$, pushing the optimum further out still (low-recall benefit-centroid shift $+0.95$), and the recall-floor gate shifts it outward again. Crucially, the redundancy downside manifests as \emph{detected collapse}, not silent error: as $K$ grows, the collapse rate rises (e.g. $0.14 \to 0.71$ at recall $0.5$) while the abstain rate falls, so over-redundancy converts to certificates rather than confident mistakes.

[FIGURE:fig4]

\textbf{The certificate is exactly zero-FP (C3).} Among the $97{,}803$ networks whose contributing edges are all sound, the Mode-A output contains the gold relation with probability $1.0$ -- the soundness invariant of path consistency -- and a detected collapse never co-occurs with an all-sound network. The overall silent-wrong rate is $5.8\%$; unsound networks decompose into $40.0\%$ absorbed-correct, $38.2\%$ detected-collapse, $11.2\%$ abstain, and only $10.6\%$ silent-wrong. The pre-registered "contains-gold slope $\approx 1$ on $J(E)$" target was not met -- the measured slope is $0.66$ -- but in the conservative direction: the convex algebra absorbs most single unsound reads, so gold is retained \emph{more} robustly than $J(E)$ predicts. We report this honestly as a certificate that over-delivers, with the slope offset correctly attributed to the independence approximation failing (the offset shrinks under $J(E)$) rather than to a soundness failure. The Allen generality arm replicates the inverted-U and the zero-FP certificate, with collapse rates reported as a lower bound (path consistency is incomplete for full Allen).

## The decisive finding: read-soundness, not closure, is the bottleneck

The recall-bite frontier pilot connects the validated mechanism to the messy reality of reading relations off news text, and its verdict is the paper's most decision-relevant result: \textbf{NO-GO/NICHE on real text, because the binding constraint is LLM read-soundness, not the closure step} [ARTIFACT:art_glhgFsBUrcYo].

[FIGURE:fig2]

Sweeping the breadth knob from "name the single relation" (S1) to "name the maximal sound set" (S5) traces recall and bite in direct tension on the same knob. Per-edge recall tops out below the pre-registered soundness gates on every real arm: TimeBank-Dense (the NarrativeTime stand-in) reaches $0.796$, MATRES $0.860$, and TDDMan only $0.579$, against gates of $0.85$ (Allen) and $0.90$ (point). Pushing the knob toward higher recall inflates breadth -- at S5 the universal-set rate reaches $0.37$ -- so the sets become too loose to resolve singletons even when sound. No recall-gated operating point reaches the $5\%$ deduction-yield floor; hence the pre-registered NO-GO. By contrast, the synthetic clean-text battery reaches recall $0.958$ at \emph{every} knob and resolves $42\%$ of deduction-required queries to the correct singleton (S1 $0.417$, S5 $0.375$), comfortably above the $10\%$ general-mechanism floor. \emph{The closure mechanism works whenever reads are sound; the failure on real text is upstream, in reading.}

Two corollaries sharpen the boundary. First, gate validation passes inside the pilot too: MATRES's deduction-required fraction is $0.000$ and its deduction-yield $0.0$, as constructed. Second, and importantly for how the contribution should be measured: on real long-distance edges read \emph{with full document context}, iterated closure provides essentially no net gain over the direct read ($\Delta \leq 0$; best closure singleton-to-correct $0.172$ vs.\ direct read $0.184$). The reason is that a full-context reader already exploits the global evidence closure would reconstruct. A local-only probe confirms the diagnosis: local reads pin the gold singleton only $26.7\%$ of the time, so closure's value must be measured against a \emph{local-only} reader (a pipeline reading one span at a time) rather than a full-context oracle. The within-document error correlation is $\rho = 0.10$, with measured joint soundness $J(2)=0.55 > r^2 = 0.48$ and $J(3)=0.34 > r^3 = 0.33$ -- positive correlation that, as the synthetic model predicts, pushes the redundancy optimum outward.

# Discussion

\textbf{What the evidence supports, and what it does not.} The three mechanism claims -- iteration error-corrects, the redundancy optimum is a recall-dependent inverted-U, and the certificate is exactly zero-FP -- are established on clean ground truth with adequate power and pre-registered trend tests. The a-priori gate is validated as discriminative ($N^\ast{=}0$ on MATRES, $25{,}450$ on NarrativeTime). What is \emph{not} supported this iteration is the real-text headline (Mode-A beating Path-of-Thoughts and voting at matched coverage, and an end-to-end hallucination-rate reduction on real news): the pre-registered recall gate fired NO-GO because a cheap reader cannot read real temporal relations soundly enough. Per our pre-registered escalation ladder, this demotes real text to an honestly scoped niche/safety-net boundary and makes the synthetic mechanism plus the bottleneck localization the headline. We resist the temptation to spin the real-text result as future work: it is a measured frontier, and the measurement is the contribution.

\textbf{Why the bottleneck localization matters.} A recurring puzzle in neuro-symbolic temporal reasoning is that consistency enforcement does not improve F1 \citep{Kougia2024, Eirew2025}. Our frontier explains the mechanism behind that puzzle from the opposite direction: when reads are sound (synthetic, recall $0.96$), exact closure resolves $42\%$ of deduction-required queries and the certificate is provably zero-FP; when reads are not sound (real news, recall $0.57$--$0.86$), no global operation can manufacture the missing soundness, and a full-context reader already captures whatever the global structure would contribute. The actionable implication is that effort in this space should move from consistency-enforcement and from full-context readers toward (a) raising per-edge read recall to the $0.85$--$0.90$ regime and (b) the local-reader setting, where a span-at-a-time pipeline has genuine information for closure to recover -- exactly the setting the local-only probe ($26.7\%$ gold-pinning) shows is non-trivial.

\textbf{Connection to the text-to-logic pipeline.} The module satisfies the surrounding pipeline's stated requirements: it is training-free and runs in milliseconds on commodity hardware; it preserves disjunction and abstains, so its outputs are certificate-backed rather than confidently guessed; and it emits a trace-graph (the QCN, which compositions fired on which paths, and any repair) that can be discharged in SWI-Prolog or ASP for a replayable proof. It targets multi-hop deduction specifically while holding atomic extraction precision/recall fixed, and it works over a relation algebra rather than a propositional encoding, avoiding the simplistic-propositional pitfall that motivated the project.

\textbf{Limitations.} (1) The real-text Mode-A and end-to-end hallucination claims are gated on reader improvement and were not confirmed; our positive narrowing evidence is synthetic plus the a-priori structural gate. (2) Path consistency is complete only for the convex point algebra; Allen/RCC-8 collapse and recovery numbers are sound lower bounds. (3) The synthetic reader is a controlled noisy channel; although we match per-edge error-type, correlation, and topology distributions to the real frontier, the total-variation distance to real error types is $0.25$, so the synthetic regime is an idealization of, not a substitute for, real reading. (4) Mode-B repair quality, the RCC-8 second-algebra arm, the CLUTRR elicited-table and absent-relation end-to-end demos, and the METRE-style alternative-reader agnosticity test were scoped as Tier-2 and are not executed here. (5) The deduction-required proxy for NarrativeTime uses a whitespace/punctuation sentence segmentation; MATRES and TDDMan locality is exact.

# Conclusion

We treated the deduction step of a text-to-logic pipeline as a coding problem: keep the LLM as a high-recall disjunctive reader, and let exact relation-algebra path consistency error-correct over the redundant constraining paths a document supplies. On clean ground truth the mechanism delivers exactly as the coding-theory lens predicts -- iterated closure (not a single intersection) error-corrects with a gap that grows from $0.0$ at hop~2 to $0.99$ at hop~6, the net narrowing gain is an inverted-U whose peak ($K^\ast=2,4,5,5,8$) tracks per-edge recall, and the certificate is exactly zero-false-positive with the only downside being detected collapse rather than silent error. A zero-LLM-spend envelope gate decides a-priori where the mechanism can apply ($N^\ast{=}0$ on adjacent-sentence MATRES, $25{,}450$ on the dense NarrativeTime timeline). And a recall-bite frontier localizes the true obstacle on real news text: read-soundness, not closure. We see three concrete next steps: (1) raise per-edge read recall into the $0.85$--$0.90$ regime, where the validated mechanism predicts a real-text payoff; (2) measure closure's value against a local-only reader, the setting the data show is non-trivial; and (3) execute the Tier-2 arms -- Mode-B repair, RCC-8, and the alternative-reader agnosticity test -- now that the mechanism and its operating envelope are characterized.

<reviewer_feedback>
STEP 1 — REVIEW: A reviewer evaluated the previous paper draft above and produced this feedback.

- [MAJOR] (scope) The paper's surviving positive evidence is entirely synthetic, and against the stated project goal almost nothing is delivered. The goal requires an operational text->FOL/Prolog pipeline with OpenCyc grounding, evaluation on RuleTaker/CLUTRR or annotated data, measured atomic-extraction precision/recall, multi-hop deduction accuracy, auditable trace-graphs, AND a quantified hallucination-rate reduction vs raw LLM generation. The paper holds atomic extraction fixed (not measured), runs no Prolog/ASP execution (only 'can be discharged'), uses no OpenCyc, scopes out CLUTRR/RuleTaker as future work, and never reports an end-to-end hallucination-rate number on real text. What remains is a synthetic validation of one sub-step (temporal/point-algebra composition) plus a negative real-text result.
  Action: Either (a) deliver a minimal but real end-to-end slice -- emit the QCN trace as Prolog/ASP, discharge a query in SWI-Prolog, and report an actual hallucination-reduction number on a few documents in the local-reader regime where the authors argue closure has value -- or (b) explicitly and prominently reframe the paper as a scoping/negative-result study on the temporal-deduction sub-step and target a venue/format (e.g., NeSy, a findings/short track) whose bar fits a careful negative result, rather than implying a full pipeline.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) The Method section enumerates seven baselines, each 'given a matched abstention signal' (raw LLM, CoT, self-consistency, LINC-style voting, Path-of-Thoughts, ILP-commit, Naive single-pass) and defines headline metrics (singleton-resolution-to-correct and selective accuracy at matched coverage, end-to-end confident-wrong rate). None of these head-to-head comparisons is actually executed in the Results: the only comparisons run are Full-vs-Naive-vs-Off internally, and a single closure-vs-direct-read delta on n=7 deduction triangles. The central comparative claim of the contribution ('Mode A beats Path-of-Thoughts and voting at matched coverage') is therefore unsupported by any experiment.
  Action: Run the listed baselines at least on the synthetic backbone (where the mechanism demonstrably works at recall 0.96) and report the matched-coverage selective-accuracy comparison. If they cannot be run this iteration, remove them from the Method/metrics and state plainly in the Results and Limitations that no baseline comparison was executed -- do not present an evaluation protocol whose results are absent.
- [MAJOR] (rigor) The paper's most decision-relevant claim -- 'the binding constraint on real news text is LLM read-soundness, not the closure step' -- is severely underpowered and rests on a single weak reader. The closure-vs-direct comparison is computed on only 7 deduction triangles for TimeBank-Dense (and 1 'broad deduction' edge), with closure actually scoring WORSE than the direct read (0.172 vs 0.184); TDDMan has 87. The reader is one cheap model (google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite) at temperature 0. Concluding that read-soundness is THE universal bottleneck, and that closure adds nothing over a full-context reader, from n=7 and one model, is not warranted.
  Action: Scale the deduction-triangle sample by an order of magnitude (the gold graphs contain many more multi-path query edges than were evaluated), report CIs on the closure-minus-direct delta, and test at least one substantially stronger reader. The recall ceiling of 0.58-0.86 may be a property of the weak model, not of the task; a stronger reader crossing the 0.85-0.90 gate would directly falsify or confirm the headline.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) Several headline 'results' are near-tautological and presented as empirical discoveries. (1) The 'exactly zero-FP certificate' (all-sound => gold-in-output probability 1.0) is the soundness invariant of path consistency -- a theorem -- not an experimental finding; verifying it on consistent-by-construction synthetic data is a sanity check. (2) The N*=25,450 'exact recovery' on NarrativeTime is guaranteed: a dense human timeline assigns numeric coordinates to every event, which is a globally consistent point-algebra network, so closure trivially recovers every pairwise relation. The authors' own honesty note confirms the graph is near-transitively-closed (full_only=0, iteration adds nothing). (3) The gate's 'discriminativeness' (MATRES N*=0 vs NarrativeTime 25,450) follows directly from the fact that MATRES only annotates same/adjacent-sentence pairs -- it restates the corpora's annotation-distance distributions.
  Action: State explicitly which claims are theorems/sanity-checks (zero-FP invariant, dense-timeline recovery, gate discriminativeness) versus genuine empirical findings, and move the empirical weight onto the non-trivial regime: sparse, long-hop, locally-read networks where iterated closure has work to do that a single pass and a full-context reader cannot. The TDDMan full_only=12 result is the genuine iteration signal; build the iteration story there and on synthetic long-hop, not on the dense timeline.
- [MAJOR] (rigor) There is an unreconciled conflation between NarrativeTime (the claimed dense co-primary) and TimeBank-Dense (the stand-in actually used for LLM reads). The T0 gate reports applicability 0.882 on NarrativeTime gold; but the recall-bite frontier pilot -- the only place real text is actually read -- uses TimeBank-Dense as the 'NarrativeTime stand-in', and there its deduction-required fraction is just 0.039, below even the 5% niche floor. So the dense applicability that justifies hosting the headline on NarrativeTime was never tested with actual reads, and the corpus that WAS read is ~22x sparser in deduction-required edges than the gate implies.
  Action: Either run the LLM reads on the actual NarrativeTime gold graphs delivered in the dataset artifact (so the 0.882 applicability is exercised with real reads), or stop transferring NarrativeTime's structural applicability to the pilot's conclusions and clearly label every read-pilot number as TimeBank-Dense with its own (low) deduction-required fraction.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) The zero-FP guarantee is conditional on every contributing read being sound -- exactly the condition the paper shows fails on real text (recall 0.58-0.86). In that regime the 'silent wrong narrowing' dual dominates: an unsound set that omits gold drives closure to a confident wrong singleton with no collapse. The synthetic silent-wrong rate is already 5.8% at recall ~0.5-0.95; at real-text recall the certificate provides little protection precisely where it is needed. Yet the abstract and Contributions lead with 'the certificate is exactly zero-FP' without the qualifier, which over-sells the safety property.
  Action: Qualify the headline to 'zero-FP conditional on read-soundness' wherever it appears, and report the silent-wrong rate as a function of per-edge recall (you have this from the synthetic channel). Make explicit that the certificate's value is bounded by (1-recall) per edge and (1-J(E)) per network, so it is strongest exactly where reads are already good and weakest in the real regime.
- [MAJOR] (rigor) The synthetic regime, on which all positive evidence rests, breaches its own pre-registered realism-matching threshold. The dossier pre-registered per-edge error-type TV <= 0.10 (and topology TV <= 0.15); the measured total-variation distance between synthetic and real error types is 0.25 -- 2.5x over the bound. By the authors' own criterion, the synthetic channel is not a valid stand-in for real reading, which undercuts any implicit 'the mechanism works on clean text, so it would work if reads improved' transfer. Relatedly, the synthetic breadth knob produces identical recall (0.958) across all five settings S1-S5, so the recall-bite trade-off that defines the frontier is never actually exercised on synthetic data.
  Action: Either tune the synthetic noisy channel to meet the pre-registered TV<=0.10 error-type match before claiming transfer, or explicitly downgrade the synthetic results to 'mechanism characterization under an idealized channel' and remove any language implying they predict real-text behavior. Add a synthetic channel whose breadth knob genuinely trades recall for bite, so the frontier mechanism is demonstrated, not just asserted, on controlled data.
- [MINOR] (evidence) Internal numeric inconsistency reduces trust. The Summary of Contributions states the iteration-gap trend has 'Page p approx 1e-13'; the Results section and the underlying artifact both report Page p approx 1.2e-4 (verified page_p=0.0001226). Separately, the headline 'gap grows from 0.0 at hop 2 to 0.99 at hop 6' is the gap at an idealized recall (~1.0); at recall 0.90 the L=6 gap is 0.63, and the paper does not state which recall slice the 0.99 figure corresponds to.
  Action: Correct the Contributions p-value to 1.2e-4 to match the data, and annotate the iteration-gap figures with the recall level they were computed at (and ideally show the gap-vs-hop curve at multiple recall levels, since the gap shrinks substantially as recall drops).
- [MINOR] (novelty) The differentiation from prior work is mostly correct but could be sharper, and the genuinely novel element (the coding-theory inverted-U) is validated only inside a simulation that sets recall and rho as knobs. Path-consistency over relation algebras (Allen, point, RCC-8), and consistency-enforcement over machine-extracted temporal relations (SputLink, CAEVO, Ning 2017, Kougia 2024, Eirew 2025), are well established; the new piece is the disjunction-preserving abstain-on-collapse contract plus the redundancy-as-coding-rate framing. The recent LLM temporal-consistency literature (e.g., temporal referential consistency, counterfactual-consistency prompting, DNF-consistency for fact-checking) is relevant context for the read-soundness claim and is not cited.
  Action: State in one sentence exactly what is new relative to classical closure (the output contract and the certificate, not the algebra), acknowledge that the inverted-U is currently a property of a simulated channel (recall and rho are inputs, not measured outcomes), and add 2-3 citations to recent LLM temporal-consistency work to situate the bottleneck finding.
- [MINOR] (scope) The 'relation algebra' generality is narrower than framed. Only the convex point algebra arm is exact (path consistency is complete for it), and a convex point network over a timeline is essentially a total/partial order. Allen IA and RCC-8 numbers are explicitly lower bounds because PC is incomplete there, and RCC-8 is never executed on real text at all. The motivating examples (kinship, legal clauses, spatial containment) are not backed by experiments -- kinship (CLUTRR) is rule-based rather than a relation algebra with composition tables and is scoped out.
  Action: Temper the generality claims to 'demonstrated on the convex point algebra (exact), with Allen as a sound lower bound and RCC-8 untested on real text', and either drop the kinship/legal framing from the abstract/intro or add at least one spatial (RCC-8) real-text arm to substantiate the multi-algebra claim.
- [MINOR] (clarity) The paper is dense to the point of being hard to evaluate without the artifacts. Key constructs (Mode A/B, J(E), N*, full_only, 'bite', non-convex widening, the inverted-U, singleton-resolution-to-correct) are introduced rapidly in prose, and the reader must track which numbers are theorems, which are synthetic, which are gold-only, and which are real reads. There is no single worked example tying the mechanism together.
  Action: Add one concrete 3-event worked example (two constraining paths to a query pair: one showing Mode-A narrowing, one showing Mode-B collapse) and a compact notation/metric table. Clearly tag each results subsection with its data source (theorem / synthetic channel / gold-only gate / real LLM reads) so the reader can immediately weight the evidence.

  Closure-Certified Composition for the LOCAL-Reader Deduction Module of a Text-to-Logic Pipeline: Iterated Path-Consistency
  Error-Corrects Span-Local LLM Reads (Synthetic-Validated and Discharged End-to-End in Prolog), the Zero-FP Certificate is
  Read-Soundness-Bounded, and Real-Text Read-Soundness is the Measured Bottleneck
hypothesis: |-
  LEAD -- FOUR ARM-SCOPED CLAIMS, EACH WITH A GENUINE DISCONFIRMER, NOW CENTERED ON THE LOCAL-READER PIPELINE REGIME WHERE iter-1 EVIDENCE SHOWS CLOSURE ACTUALLY HAS WORK TO DO (read first; everything below elaborates).

  (LOCAL-READER VALUE CLAIM -- THE NEW HEADLINE.) In a MODULAR pipeline that reads each event/entity pair from ONLY its local span (the architecture a text->FOL/Prolog pipeline must use to build a reusable knowledge base, not to answer one query from the whole document), composing those span-local LLM reads by ITERATED path-consistency closure recovers deduction-required relations the local reads alone cannot, achieving strictly higher SELECTIVE ACCURACY AT MATCHED COVERAGE than (a) the local raw LLM forced to a single relation, (b) Path-of-Thoughts, and (c) self-consistency voting, AND cutting the CONFIDENT-WRONG (hallucination) rate versus the local raw LLM on absent-relation pairs -- both CI-separated under paired bootstrap. SCOPE CORRECTION FORCED BY iter-1: closure provides essentially NO net gain over a FULL-CONTEXT reader (measured delta<=0; best closure singleton-to-correct 0.172 vs direct full-context read 0.184), because a reader given the whole document already reconstructs the global evidence closure would; the iter-1 local-only probe pins gold only 26.7% of the time, so closure's value is DEFINED ONLY against a local reader, and that is the comparison we run. DISCONFIRMED if closure-over-local-reads beats NEITHER the local raw LLM NOR PoT/voting at matched coverage -- in which case the contribution becomes the negative localization plus the synthetic mechanism, honestly targeted at NeSy / a findings/short track.

  (END-TO-END DELIVERABLE CLAIM -- THE PROJECT-GOAL ANCHOR, no longer 'can be discharged'.) The closed QCN is emitted as executable Prolog/ASP, the held-out query is DISCHARGED in SWI-Prolog, and we report an ACTUAL quantified hallucination-rate reduction versus raw LLM generation on real documents in the local-reader regime -- the project's literal deliverable, which iter-1 only described as hypothetical. CLUTRR kinship (an explicitly named target benchmark, naturally span-local, composition-required, with a finite kinship composition table) is the clean end-to-end venue that delivers all four required numbers at once: atomic-extraction precision/recall, multi-hop deduction accuracy, human-auditable trace-graphs, and the hallucination-rate reduction; the temporal corpora supply the harder, naturalistic arm. DISCONFIRMED if no end-to-end hallucination reduction materializes at the pre-registered minimum effect on any real venue.

  (ITERATION CLAIM -- RELOCATED OFF THE DENSE TIMELINE.) FULL ITERATED closure beats NAIVE single-pass intersection with a gap that GROWS in hop-count and cyclomatic number, demonstrated on synthetic long-hop/cyclic networks AND on SPARSE long-hop real gold (TDDMan, where iter-1 found the genuine signal: full_only=12, 408 vs 396 resolved) -- NOT on dense timelines (NarrativeTime full_only=0, near-transitively-closed, where iteration provably ties single-pass and 'recovery' is guaranteed, not earned). DISCONFIRMED if full==naive even on sparse multi-hop/cyclic queries (then the contribution is 'any intersection,' not ITERATION).

  (REDUNDANCY CLAIM -- UNCHANGED IN FORM, RE-TAGGED AS CHANNEL-SIMULATION EVIDENCE.) At fixed per-edge recall, net Mode-A gain is an INVERTED-U in path redundancy whose peak moves outward with recall (iter-1 synthetic: K*=2,4,5,5,8 for recall 0.5->0.95) and shifts under a recall-floor gate; the genuine disconfirmer is the ABSENCE of any redundancy region beating BOTH best-single-path and naive-intersection -- a flat/turned-over curve ALONE is the predicted recall x redundancy interaction, not a disconfirmation. HONEST CAVEAT (reviewer): recall and rho are INPUTS to the iter-1 simulated channel, not measured outcomes, so this is currently a property of a controlled channel -- to be reproduced with a channel whose breadth knob genuinely trades recall for bite and whose per-edge error-type distribution matches real reads (TV<=0.10) before any transfer to real text is implied.

  WHAT iter-1 ESTABLISHED, TAGGED BY EVIDENCE CLASS (so no result is over-weighted). (THEOREM / SANITY-CHECK, not empirical discoveries): the zero-FP certificate (all contributing reads sound => gold in output with probability 1.0) is the soundness invariant of path-consistency, verified on consistent-by-construction data; the N*=25,450 'exact recovery' on NarrativeTime is GUARANTEED because a dense human timeline IS a globally-consistent point network that closure trivially recovers; the gate's discriminativeness (MATRES N*=0 vs NarrativeTime 25,450) merely restates the corpora's annotation-distance distributions. These are design validations, NOT the contribution. (GENUINE SYNTHETIC EMPIRICAL FINDINGS): the iteration gap growing with hop/cyclomatic (Page p~=1.2e-4 -- CORRECTED from the paper's mis-stated 1e-13; the gap is recall-dependent, e.g. L=6 gap 0.99 at recall~=1.0 but 0.63 at recall 0.90, so it MUST be reported per-recall-slice); the recall-dependent inverted-U; and the silent-wrong rate (5.8% pooled) as a function of per-edge recall. (GOLD-ONLY GATE): the a-priori envelope per corpus. (REAL LLM READS -- the one real negative result): the recall-bite frontier NO-GO (no real arm cleared the soundness gate at the tested cheap reader). The contribution's empirical weight must rest on the GENUINE FINDINGS plus the NEW local-reader and end-to-end tests, never on the theorems.

  THE SIX FIXES THIS ITERATION (each tied to an iter-1 finding or a reviewer critique).
  FIX 1 -- RELOCATE VALUE TO THE LOCAL-READER REGIME. iter-1 showed closure ~= full-context read (delta<=0) yet local reads miss ~73% of deduction-required gold; so the head-to-head is closure-over-LOCAL-reads vs {local raw LLM, PoT, voting}, NEVER vs a full-context oracle. This is also the only setting consistent with the project's modular text->FOL pipeline (atomic facts must be extracted span-by-span to populate a reusable knowledge base).
  FIX 2 -- DELIVER THE END-TO-END SLICE FOR REAL. Emit Prolog/ASP from the closed QCN, discharge in SWI-Prolog, and report an ACTUAL hallucination-rate number. Promote CLUTRR to a Tier-1 end-to-end venue (atomic P/R + multi-hop accuracy + trace-graph + hallucination reduction in one). Stop describing discharge as hypothetical.
  FIX 3 -- ACTUALLY RUN THE BASELINES. The seven enumerated baselines (raw LLM, CoT, self-consistency, LINC-style voting, Path-of-Thoughts, ILP-commit, naive single-pass) were NEVER executed in iter-1, so the central comparative claim ('Mode A beats PoT and voting') was unsupported. Run them at matched coverage AT LEAST on the synthetic backbone (mechanism works at recall 0.96) AND on the local-reader real slice. Any baseline not run is REMOVED from the protocol, not left as a promise.
  FIX 4 -- QUALIFY THE CERTIFICATE AS READ-SOUNDNESS-BOUNDED. Everywhere, state 'zero-FP CONDITIONAL ON READ-SOUNDNESS.' Report the silent-wrong rate as an explicit function of per-edge recall; state the per-edge bound (1-recall) and per-network bound (1-J(E)); make explicit that the certificate is STRONGEST where reads are already good and WEAKEST in the real low-recall regime where it is most needed -- the honest tension, surfaced, not hidden in the abstract.
  FIX 5 -- UN-CONFLATE NarrativeTime FROM TimeBank-Dense AND POWER THE BOTTLENECK CLAIM. iter-1 read TimeBank-Dense as a 'NarrativeTime stand-in' (deduction-required fraction 0.039) while transferring NarrativeTime's gate applicability (0.882) -- a ~22x mismatch. Run LLM reads on the ACTUAL NarrativeTime gold graphs (delivered in the dataset artifact) so the 0.882 applicability is exercised with real reads. Scale the closure-vs-direct deduction-triangle sample by >=10x (iter-1 used n=7 for TimeBank-Dense, with closure scoring WORSE 0.172 vs 0.184), report CIs on the closure-minus-direct delta, and test >=2 readers INCLUDING one substantially stronger model -- the recall ceiling 0.58-0.86 may be a weak-model property, and a reader crossing the 0.85/0.90 gate would directly confirm or falsify the read-soundness-bottleneck headline.
  FIX 6 -- REPAIR THE SYNTHETIC CHANNEL'S REALISM. iter-1 breached its own pre-registered TV<=0.10 (measured TV=0.25, 2.5x over) and its breadth knob produced identical recall (0.958) across all five settings S1-S5, so the recall-bite trade-off was never exercised on synthetic data. Either tune the noisy channel to TV<=0.10 with a breadth knob that GENUINELY trades recall for bite, or explicitly downgrade ALL synthetic results to 'mechanism characterization under an idealized channel' with no implied transfer to real-text behavior.

  MODE A (SOUND NARROWING, PRIMARY, READ-SOUNDNESS-CONDITIONAL zero-FP). The local reader emits per span a high-recall sub-universal disjunction (with an explicit universal/underdetermined option); intersecting the compositions arriving at the query pair from multiple constraining paths yields a still-sound, strictly-tighter set. The load-bearing metric is SINGLETON-RESOLUTION-TO-CORRECT (intersection collapses the query to the single correct relation), the only yield that moves matched-coverage selective accuracy and the hallucination rate; strict-tightening is reported separately and stated non-load-bearing. Mode A needs only sub-universal breadth + multi-path bite, not over-commitment; it is inert only in the all-universal limit; its zero-FP property survives PC incompleteness (intersection of sound sets is sound) but is CONDITIONAL on every contributing read being sound.
  MODE B (DETECTION/REPAIR, SECONDARY). An empty closure certifies that some read is UNSOUND -- a gold-free, zero-FP DETECTION flag (conditional on recall) -- carrying the pre-registered dual of SILENT WRONG NARROWING (an unsound set OMITTING gold drives a confident WRONG singleton with no collapse); magnitude tracks the measured over-commitment rate; Reiter-style minimal-hitting-set repair (which can mislocalize) is reported distinctly from Mode A.
  ITERATION ISOLATION. Naive = single-pass query-node intersection (no fixpoint, no algebra-seeded converse propagation) = 'PoT plus one obvious intersection step'; it COINCIDES with full closure on length-2 multi-path queries (verified) and diverges on >=3-edge/cyclic structure, so the full-minus-naive gap isolates ITERATED path-consistency -- built on TDDMan + synthetic long-hop, NOT on the dense timeline.
  LOCAL-READER REGIME (load-bearing definition). A local-only reader sees ONLY the minimal span(s) where two events co-occur (or flags 'no shared span'); edges it confidently and correctly names are DIRECTLY-READABLE, the rest are DEDUCTION-REQUIRED (obtainable only by composing >=2 edges). The honest pipeline reads atomically/locally to populate the FOL knowledge base, THEN composes -- so closure's value is measured exactly here, never against a full-context oracle that bypasses the modular architecture.

  REDUNDANCY AS A CODING RATE, AUDITED ON EMPIRICAL JOINT SOUNDNESS. Mode A's zero-FP narrowing holds only when EVERY contributing edge is sound; a single LLM reading one document produces positively-correlated errors, so instead of the independence product prod_e r_e we MEASURE the empirical joint soundness J(E) and report the within-document cross-edge error correlation rho. The inverted-U cost term is 1-J(E); positive rho makes J(E) decay slower than r^E, pushing the peak outward. iter-1 confirmed J(E)>r^E (e.g. J(2)=0.55>0.48, J(3)=0.34>0.33 with rho=0.10) -- but, per FIX 6, this must be re-shown on a realism-matched channel before transfer.

  GENERALITY, TEMPERED (reviewer). EXACT only on the convex point algebra (PC complete; a timeline is a partial order); Allen IA and RCC-8 numbers are SOUND LOWER BOUNDS (PC incomplete); RCC-8 is untested on real text and CLUTRR kinship is a finite composition table, not a full relation algebra. Generality is scoped to 'demonstrated on convex point (exact) + Allen (lower bound) + kinship composition (end-to-end)', with an RCC-8 real-text spatial arm as an OPTIONAL stretch, not asserted; spatial/legal framing is removed from the abstract unless backed by an executed arm.

  NOVELTY, STATED PRECISELY (reviewer). New is NOT the algebra or closure (Allen/point/RCC-8, SputLink, CAEVO, Ning 2017, Kougia 2024, Eirew 2025 are established) but (1) the disjunction-PRESERVING, abstain-on-collapse OUTPUT CONTRACT that inverts the F1-maximizing commit objective, (2) the gold-free closure CERTIFICATE, and (3) the redundancy-as-coding-rate inverted-U -- with the explicit caveat that (3) is so far a simulated-channel property (recall and rho are inputs, not measured outcomes). Situate the read-soundness finding against recent LLM temporal-consistency work (temporal referential consistency, counterfactual-consistency prompting, DNF-consistency for fact-checking), to be cited.

  SUCCESS. CONFIRM if: (LOCAL-READER) closure-over-local-reads beats the local raw LLM AND PoT AND voting at matched coverage with adjusted-CI separation, on >=1 real venue and/or CLUTRR; (END-TO-END) a Prolog-discharged pipeline shows a hallucination-rate reduction >= the pre-registered minimum vs raw LLM, with atomic-extraction P/R and multi-hop accuracy reported and a human-auditable trace-graph; (ITERATION) the full-minus-naive gap grows with hop/cyclomatic on synthetic AND TDDMan, reported per-recall-slice; (REDUNDANCY) the inverted-U with outward-moving peak at the pre-registered precision, ON A REALISM-MATCHED CHANNEL. DISCONFIRM / SCOPE-BOUNDARY if: closure adds nothing over local reads (contribution = negative localization + synthetic mechanism, retargeted to NeSy/findings); no end-to-end hallucination reduction at the minimum effect; full==naive on multi-hop/cyclic; or no realism-matched channel reproduces the inverted-U.

  HONESTY COMMITMENTS. (1) TAG every reported number as THEOREM / SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL / GOLD-ONLY-GATE / REAL-LLM-READ, so its evidence class is legible; (2) zero-FP is READ-SOUNDNESS-CONDITIONAL and silent-wrong is reported as a function of recall; (3) baselines are RUN or REMOVED, never promised; (4) the real-text NO-GO stands as a measured frontier unless a stronger reader OR the local-reader regime changes it; (5) include one concrete 3-event WORKED EXAMPLE (one Mode-A narrowing path, one Mode-B collapse path) and a compact notation/metric table so a reader can immediately weight the evidence.
motivation: >-
  Faithful multi-hop relational reasoning over short professional text -- temporal ordering of events in news, kinship in
  narratives, containment/region relations in descriptions -- is where LLM hallucination is most damaging and where a text-to-logic
  pipeline most needs to fuse explicit document facts with implicit composition knowledge while staying auditable. The umbrella
  pipeline reads text into FOL/Prolog predicates, types entities against an upper ontology, and answers queries with a reasoner;
  the WEAK LINK is the composition/deduction step. Existing systems handle composition unsatisfyingly: humans hand-craft composition
  rules (the kinship rules behind CLUTRR), which do not scale; the LLM composes freely, locally fluent but globally inconsistent,
  producing silent errors that solver-crash feedback (Logic-LM) and answer voting (LINC) cannot see; or paths are reasoned
  in ISOLATION (LAMBADA, Path-of-Thoughts), which deliberately avoids the global check and so cannot tighten a disjunctive
  query by intersecting evidence from multiple paths nor detect contradictions arriving at the same pair from two paths. A
  cluster of negative/commit-contract results sharpens the opportunity: Knez & Sun (2024, arXiv:2406.11486) show zero-shot
  LLMs assign MORE THAN ONE temporal relation to a pair for >=50% (up to 97%) of pairs and violate transitivity, then enforce
  consistency with ILP and find it DOES NOT improve F1; and -- decisively up to date -- a 2025 global zero-shot temporal-graph
  generator (arXiv:2502.11114, EMNLP 2025) STILL enforces uniqueness/symmetry/transitivity by ILP, committing to a single
  label per pair, preserving no disjunction, issuing no certificate, and offering no abstention. We read this lineage as evidence
  that consistency enforcement under the F1-maximizing COMMIT contract is the wrong objective; the LLM's native multi-relation
  output is not noise to be collapsed but a SOUND DISJUNCTION to be PRESERVED and NARROWED, and the right objective is faithfulness-by-abstention,
  not extraction F1. The qualitative-reasoning community has had exact, commodity-cheap path-consistency algorithms over relation
  algebras (Allen 1983; Renz & Nebel; GQR, SparQ) for forty years, but they assume a clean hand-given table and have never
  been coupled to an LLM reading relations off natural language. We are NOT the first to run closure over machine-extracted
  temporal relations (SputLink densifies TimeBank; CAEVO does global temporal inference via cascaded sieves; Ning et al.'s
  ILP enforces transitivity) -- but ALL COMMIT to a single consistent labeling to maximize F1, preserving no disjunction,
  certifying no reading error, offering no abstention. Our contribution is the OPPOSITE output contract: keep the LLM's job
  as high-recall disjunctive READING, use cross-path INTERSECTION as a zero-FP faithfulness operation (Mode A) and closure
  COLLAPSE as a gold-free reading-error certificate (Mode B), and optimize faithfulness via a risk-coverage objective. Three
  ideas make the transfer a genuine contribution rather than a port. FIRST, because Allen/point/RCC-8 tables are EXACT ground
  truth, cross-path intersection of SOUND sets can only move toward gold -- a calibration-free, zero-FP narrowing that needs
  no over-commitment and no labels, and multi-path redundancy becomes an ERROR-CORRECTING CODE over LLM extractions. SECOND,
  the coding-theory lens predicts an OPTIMAL RATE: narrowing stays zero-FP only while all contributing edges are sound and
  that JOINT probability (measured EMPIRICALLY as J(E), not assumed independent) decays with redundancy, so net benefit is
  an INVERTED-U whose peak we predict from measured recall and the measured cross-edge error correlation and shift with a
  recall-floor gate. THIRD, the objective inverts F1 -- we preserve disjunctive uncertainty and ABSTAIN, trading coverage
  for faithfulness, and we measure the ACTIONABLE yield (intersection-to-correct-singleton at matched coverage) and the DOWNSTREAM
  hallucination-rate reduction, not whether a set merely shrank. The decisive realism move this iteration is choosing the
  corpus that can ACTUALLY host the claim: MATRES annotates only same/adjacent-sentence pairs, so its deduction-required envelope
  is empty BY CONSTRUCTION; the headline must live on a DENSE, direct-human-gold corpus (NarrativeTime, full TLink coverage,
  human-timeline gold) and be corroborated where gold is provably non-closure-derived (TDDMan long-distance manual pairs).
  If it works, this is a general, training-free recipe for trustworthy relational deduction over text with quantified, certificate-backed
  hallucination reduction and replayable trace-graphs; if it fails (intersection rarely resolves correct singletons because
  real sets are near-universal; the redundancy peak sits at trivially low redundancy; recall failures dominate the joint-soundness
  bound; or even the dense corpus's deduction-required multi-path-with-bite slice is below the pre-registered applicability
  number), each is itself a publishable scope boundary on repairing LLM-read relational knowledge.
assumptions:
- >-
  ARM-SCOPED CLAIMS + DENSE-CORPUS RELOCATION (resolves the prior contradiction AND the MATRES-locality problem). The real-text
  narrowing/hallucination win is claimed on a DENSE direct-human-gold corpus's deduction-required multi-path subset (NarrativeTime
  CO-PRIMARY; TDDMan non-circularity corroboration), NOT on MATRES, which is EXPECTED TO FAIL the deduction-required gate
  by construction (same/adjacent-sentence annotation -> all gold local). Mode A beats path-isolated Path-of-Thoughts and answer-voting;
  it TIES naive single-pass intersection on length-2 queries; FULL ITERATED closure beats naive ONLY where >=3-edge/cyclic
  structure exists -- now demonstrated on synthetic AND, where T0 finds a usable real-text stratum, on real text.
- >-
  CORPUS ALGEBRA & NON-CIRCULARITY CHARACTERIZED A-PRIORI FOR ALL CORPORA (before any LLM spend). NarrativeTime gold = HUMAN
  TIMELINE placement (manual, full TLink coverage, IAA alpha ~0.68), restrictable to START-POINTS -> CONVEX POINT ALGEBRA
  where PC is COMPLETE and the table exact (full-interval Allen scored as a lower-bound detector); its non-local gold is human-holistic,
  NOT algorithmic-closure output, so closure recovery over independently-read edges is non-circular -- quantified by the LOCALLY-JUSTIFIABLE
  vs PURELY-TIMELINE-IMPLIED fraction. TDDMan gold = direct human annotation of long-distance pairs explicitly NOT auto-inferable
  -> a structurally non-circular anchor whose win moots the timeline-circularity worry. Mode A's zero-FP soundness SURVIVES
  PC incompleteness (intersection of sound sets is always sound), so the mechanism is not lost where completeness fails.
- >-
  REDUNDANCY IS DOUBLE-EDGED, AUDITED ON EMPIRICAL JOINT SOUNDNESS (no independence assumption). Mode A's zero-FP narrowing
  holds only when ALL contributing edges are sound. We MEASURE the empirical joint soundness J(E) and report the within-document
  cross-edge reading-error correlation rho. Net Mode-A gain is an INVERTED-U in redundancy at fixed recall, cost term 1 -
  J(E), peak located using empirical J(E); positive rho pushes the peak outward. A flat/non-monotone curve is the predicted
  recall x redundancy interaction, not a disconfirmation.
- >-
  A-PRIORI ENVELOPE GATE EXTENDED TO ALL CORPORA + CONCRETE APPLICABILITY THRESHOLD. From each gold graph alone (zero LLM
  spend) we count N* (deduction-required AND >=2-path AND bite-after-widening AND singleton-resolving) AND the >=3-edge/cyclic
  prevalence (the real-text iteration envelope), with a paired-bootstrap power calc, for NarrativeTime, TDDMan AND MATRES;
  we report widening-induced bite loss; and we pre-register the applicability-envelope threshold as a NUMBER (deduction-required
  multi-path-with-bite fraction >=10% of evaluable held-out edges = 'general mechanism'; 5-10% = 'useful module'; <5% = 'niche
  safety-net'). The headline is never contingent on an unmeasured quantity.
- >-
  ACTIONABLE YIELD = SINGLETON-RESOLUTION-TO-CORRECT + DOWNSTREAM HALLUCINATION REDUCTION, AND RECALL-AND-RHO-MATCHED READER-AGNOSTICITY.
  The matched-coverage win and the hallucination-rate drop are both driven by intersection-to-correct-SINGLETON (strict-tightening
  reported separately, stated non-load-bearing); the coverage axis (single-relation resolution) is applied IDENTICALLY to
  closure and every baseline. The gain is attributable to the ALGEBRA: swapping the disjunctive edge-reader preserves the
  gain when each alternative reader is tuned to MATCHED per-edge recall AND its rho is reported (conditioned on rho if it
  differs materially), so reader-specific error correlation cannot confound the conclusion.
investigation_approach: |-
  TIERING (pre-committed; T0 then Tier-1 must COMPLETE before Tier-2; a fully-executed T0+Tier-1 with a thin Tier-2 is the acceptable minimum publishable unit). T0 -- A-PRIORI ENVELOPE GATE FOR ALL CORPORA (zero LLM spend): from each gold graph compute N* (deduction-required AND >=2-path AND bite-after-widening AND singleton-resolving), the >=3-edge/cyclic prevalence, the widening-induced bite loss, and a paired-bootstrap power calc, for NarrativeTime, TDDMan AND MATRES; for NarrativeTime also compute the locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied split (non-circularity audit, structural proxy only). Decide hosting via the pre-registered applicability NUMBER; the expected MATRES N* ~ 0 vs NarrativeTime/TDDMan N* >> 0 is reported as gate validation. TIER-1 (headline-critical, on the dense co-primary): (T1) the RECALL-BITE FRONTIER map + pre-registered go/no-go; (T2) the real-text Mode-A comparison vs Path-of-Thoughts and self-consistency at MATCHED COVERAGE with paired-bootstrap CIs, stratified by deduction-required vs directly-readable; (T2b) the END-TO-END HALLUCINATION-REDUCTION on the deduction-required/absent-relation subset vs a raw LLM, with a PRE-REGISTERED minimum effect size; (T3) the SYNTHETIC long-hop/cyclic redundancy-scaling DECOMPOSITION separating Mode-A BENEFIT from silent-narrowing COST, locating the inverted-U peak, conditioning the zero-FP audit on EMPIRICAL J(E), PLUS a coarse REAL-TEXT decomposition anchor binned by contributing-edge count; (T4) the isolating ablations -- closure ON/OFF table-held-fixed, Mode-A-only, and NAIVE-INTERSECTION vs FULL ITERATED closure with hop/cyclomatic stratification ON BOTH synthetic AND the dense corpus's real >=3-edge/cyclic stratum (the iteration claim). TIER-2 (runs only after Tier-1): TDDMan non-circularity replication, RCC-8 second algebra, CLUTRR elicited-table ablation + absent-relation end-to-end demo, TimeBank-Dense (framed noisy-read-vs-clean-read), Mode-B repair quality, the METRE-style alternative-reader ablation, exploratory semiring variant.

  MULTIPLICITY POLICY (pre-registered; inoculates against a garden-of-forking-paths objection). CONFIRMATORY FAMILY (Holm-Bonferroni / hierarchical gatekeeping across the family; report ADJUSTED CIs): (H1) real-text Mode-A selective-accuracy gap vs PoT & voting; (H2) end-to-end hallucination-rate reduction vs raw LLM; (H3) full-minus-naive iteration gap growing with hop/cyclomatic; (H4) the single redundancy inverted-U disconfirmer. H1 and H2 are the gateway tests; H3/H4 are tested only if a gateway clears. EVERYTHING ELSE -- per-stratum splits, per-bin curves, reader-agnosticity, Mode-B repair, RCC-8/CLUTRR/TB-Dense, the real-text iteration stratum (corroborative) -- is EXPLORATORY, reported with nominal CIs and labelled as such.

  EMPIRICAL-J(E) ATTRIBUTION RULE (stated ONCE here): a reliability-slope offset that DISAPPEARS when the predictor is switched from the independence product r^E to empirical J(E) is the independence approximation failing (NOT a disconfirmation); an offset that PERSISTS under empirical J(E) is a genuine soundness failure. ESCALATION LADDER (stated ONCE here): the dense direct-human-gold CO-PRIMARY is NarrativeTime if its T0 N* clears the applicability number; TDDMan corroborates and supplies a non-circularity-clean (and harder) arm; MATRES is the gate-validation control; if NO real corpus clears the number even after these, the synthetic arm becomes the headline and real text is demoted to an honestly-scoped niche-safety-net boundary -- but T0 makes that decision before LLM spend.

  COMPACT LOGICAL STRUCTURE (claim -> precondition -> metric -> baseline -> CI test). [H1 REAL-TEXT NARROWING] Mode-A singleton-resolution-to-correct > PoT & self-consistency (ties naive-intersection) -> precondition: dense-corpus deduction-required multi-path-with-bite subset with N* powering the CI (from T0) -> metric: selective accuracy at matched coverage -> baselines: PoT (path-agreement abstain), self-consistency (vote margin) -> paired-bootstrap adjusted CI on the gap, separated from 0. [H2 HALLUCINATION REDUCTION] closure pipeline confident-wrong rate < raw-LLM on the absent-relation subset -> precondition: same subset -> metric: confident-wrong (non-abstained gold-mismatch) rate -> baseline: raw LLM forced to a single relation -> paired-bootstrap adjusted CI meeting the pre-registered minimum effect. [H3 ITERATION] full closure > naive-intersection, gap grows with hop/cyclomatic -> precondition: paths longer than 2 / cycles present (synthetic; real >=3-edge/cyclic stratum) -> metric: selective-accuracy gap vs hop-count bin -> baseline: naive single-pass intersection -> per-bin adjusted CI + monotone-trend test. [H4 REDUNDANCY OPTIMUM] net gain inverted-U with located peak; peak increases with recall; gate shifts it -> precondition: >=4 fixed per-edge-recall arms + estimation-precision pre-reg -> metric: separate benefit and cost curves vs redundancy (synthetic + coarse real anchor) -> peak-detection meeting the >=1-bin shift bar. [C2 PATH-CONSISTENCY] closure ON > OFF, table held FIXED -> paired bootstrap (exploratory). [C3 ZERO-FP AUDIT] realized fraction-still-contains-gold tracks EMPIRICAL J(E), slope ~1 (exploratory). [C5 READER-AGNOSTIC] gain persists under swapped reader at matched recall AND reported rho (exploratory). [C6 MODE-B] zero-FP DETECTION; repair toward gold (exploratory).

  PILOT AS A FRONTIER MAP (after T0, before main runs). On synthetic and real edges, SWEEP a prompt-elicited breadth knob across >=5 settings from 'name THE relation' to 'name the maximal SOUND set the text does not exclude.' At each setting MEASURE: per-edge RECALL = P(gold in emitted set); breadth distribution; over-commitment vs under-specification rate; raw closure-collapse rate; strict-tightening AND singleton-resolution-to-correct yields; local-only-reader accuracy defining the deduction-required fraction; and the within-document cross-edge reading-error correlation rho. PLOT the RECALL-BITE FRONTIER as a primary deliverable and pre-register go/no-go (a region clearing a recall gate AND non-trivial singleton-resolution-to-correct) BEFORE any main run. PRE-REGISTER the EXTENDED REALISM-MATCHING STATISTIC for the synthetic NL-realization: total-variation distance between real and synthetic per-edge error-type distributions PLUS a cross-edge error-CORRELATION (rho) match term PLUS a redundancy/path-topology match (contributing-edge-count and cycle-structure histograms), thresholds FIXED before generating the redundancy curve.

  PIPELINE (four stages). (1) NEURAL READING -- prompt the LLM (via OpenRouter, cheap model, short docs, caching; well under $10) to map each surface relation phrase onto a SOUND DISJUNCTION of canonical base relations at the pre-registered frontier operating point; for the NarrativeTime point-algebra arm restrict emitted vocabulary to CONVEX point relations on start-points (widen non-convex {<,>} to VAGUE) so PC stays COMPLETE, and MEASURE the bite lost. (2) ALGEBRA -- use the EXACT published composition table (Allen 13-relation, point algebra, RCC-8; the convex table for the coarse interval label sets); seed converses/identity from the algebra, never from an LLM. (3) SYMBOLIC CLOSURE -- build a QCN (nodes=events/entities, edges=relation SETS; query/held-out edge starts universal), run path-consistency to a FIXPOINT. Three instrumented variants: FULL iterated PC; NAIVE single-pass intersection at the query node (no fixpoint, no converse seeding); closure-OFF (table fixed). MODE A narrows by cross-path intersection and emits an answer ONLY when the query resolves to a single relation (coverage axis), else ABSTAINS. MODE B (Tier-2): an empty collapse CERTIFIES a reading error; compute a minimal Reiter-style hitting-set/MaxSAT repair preferring lowest-confidence edges, recording the diagnosis and flagging possible mislocalization. (4) AUDIT -- emit the QCN, which compositions fired on which paths, and repairs as a TRACE-GRAPH, optionally discharged in SWI-Prolog/ASP from the closed table for a replayable proof (connective tissue to the umbrella pipeline's auditability + quantified-hallucination-reduction requirements).

  DATASETS. DENSE REAL-TEXT CO-PRIMARY: NarrativeTime / TimeBankNT (Rogers et al., LREC-COLING 2024; arXiv:1908.11443) -- timeline-based FULL-coverage human re-annotation of TimeBank-Dense (news), IAA alpha ~0.68; start-point restriction -> convex point algebra (PC COMPLETE), full-interval arm as lower-bound detector; non-local gold is HUMAN-timeline-placed (non-circular vs algorithmic PC). NON-CIRCULARITY ANCHOR: TDDMan (Naik et al., TDDiscourse 2019; aclanthology W19-5929) -- MANUAL long-distance (>1-sentence-apart) pairs that 'cannot be inferred automatically from existing annotations'; relation set {before, after, simultaneous, includes, is_included}, mutually exclusive (no VAGUE), coarse interval algebra; cleanest non-circularity, used to replicate the narrowing win where gold is provably not a closure artifact. GATE-VALIDATION CONTROL: MATRES (Ning, Wu & Roth 2018) -- same/adjacent-sentence annotation, expected N* ~ 0 on the deduction-required gate, demonstrating the gate discriminates. SYNTHETIC PRIMARY (clean ground truth, controlled redundancy): a Renz-Nebel-style random consistent Allen/point QCN generator GUARANTEEING redundant paths/cycles and sweeping redundancy/density/hop-count INDEPENDENTLY; the NL-realization protocol is VALIDATED to clear the EXTENDED realism statistic; the redundancy DECOMPOSITION is reported at >=4 FIXED per-edge-recall levels with >=500 networks per cell. SECOND ALGEBRA: RCC-8 synthetic. ELICITED-TABLE VENUE: CLUTRR kinship (LLM-elicited table vs gold) doubling as an end-to-end hallucination-reduction-on-ABSENT-relation demo. TimeBank-Dense as a Tier-2 noisy-read-vs-clean-read arm; RuleTaker an out-of-scope propositional contrast.

  KEY ABLATIONS: (i) closure/intersection ON vs OFF with the table HELD FIXED; (ii) NAIVE single-pass vs FULL iterated closure with hop/cyclomatic stratification (synthetic + real); (iii) Mode A ONLY vs Mode A+B; (iv) disjunction OFF (force singletons); (v) exact-table vs LLM-elicited-table (kinship); (vi) recall-floor gate ON vs OFF; (vii) ALTERNATIVE EDGE-READER (METRE-style multi-label head + a second LLM into the SAME closure pipeline -- recall-AND-rho-matched). BASELINES, EACH WITH A MATCHED ABSTENTION SIGNAL thresholded to the SAME coverage object: raw LLM (verbalized confidence), CoT, self-consistency (vote margin), LINC-style multi-formalization vote, DSR-LM-style induced-rule Prolog (no closure), Path-of-Thoughts (PRIMARY real-text baseline; path-agreement abstain), NAIVE single-pass intersection (iteration contrast), a TempRel-style COMMIT baseline, and a soft-unification neural theorem prover.

  METRICS, per-regime and STRATIFIED: (1) SINGLETON-RESOLUTION-TO-CORRECT yield + risk-coverage/selective accuracy AT MATCHED COVERAGE (HEADLINE H1) with paired-bootstrap adjusted CIs, reported alongside strict-tightening yield (stated non-load-bearing); (2) END-TO-END hallucination-rate reduction vs raw LLM on the deduction-required/absent-relation subset (HEADLINE H2) with a pre-registered minimum effect; (3) empirical zero-FP audit CONDITIONED on EMPIRICAL J(E) (reliability curve slope ~1; rho reported); (4) REDUNDANCY DECOMPOSITION (benefit vs silent-narrowing cost, located peak, gate shift) on SYNTHETIC + coarse REAL anchor; (5) full-minus-naive gap vs hop/cyclomatic on SYNTHETIC and the real >=3-edge/cyclic stratum; (6) Mode-B detection (lower bound on Allen IA/RCC-8, exact on the point-algebra arm) + repair quality; (7) reader-agnostic closure delta at matched recall and reported rho; (8) APPLICABILITY ENVELOPE -- relation-composable, multi-path-with-bite, deduction-required, AND >=3-edge/cyclic fractions per corpus (N* up front), scored against the pre-registered NUMBER; (9) atomic extraction P/R as a HELD-FIXED control; (10) the non-circularity audit (locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied fraction on NarrativeTime). Closure and repair run in milliseconds per network on a laptop.
success_criteria: |-
  THREE ARM-SCOPED HEADLINE PREDICTIONS (stated before all qualifiers; the confirmatory family H1-H4 is Holm-Bonferroni-adjusted, H1/H2 are gateways). CONFIRM lines: (REAL-TEXT) On the dense co-primary's deduction-required multi-path-with-bite subset at the pre-registered frontier operating point, Mode A achieves strictly higher SELECTIVE ACCURACY AT MATCHED COVERAGE than Path-of-Thoughts AND self-consistency (H1), AND cuts the CONFIDENT-WRONG (hallucination) rate versus a raw LLM on the same absent-relation pairs by at least the pre-registered minimum effect (H2) -- both adjusted-CI-separated from zero, driven by singleton-resolution-to-correct; Mode A is PREDICTED TO TIE naive single-pass intersection on the length-2 stratum and that tie is reported as confirmation, not failure. (ITERATION) FULL ITERATED closure beats NAIVE single-pass intersection with the gap GROWING in hop-count/cyclomatic number (and ~0 on length-2) on synthetic QCNs AND, where T0 found a usable real >=3-edge/cyclic stratum, on real text (H3). (REDUNDANCY) Net Mode-A gain is an INVERTED-U whose peak increases with recall and shifts outward under the recall-floor gate, at the pre-registered estimation precision (>=4 recall levels, >=500 networks/cell, >=1-bin minimum-detectable peak shift, peak bin CI-above both neighbors) (H4). Additionally CONFIRMS if: T0 reports N* clearing the applicability NUMBER on >=1 real corpus (NarrativeTime preferred, TDDMan corroborating) so the headline is genuine deduction not re-reading; the empirical zero-FP audit tracks J(E) (slope ~1, rho reported, slope-offset correctly attributed); the coarse real-text redundancy anchor matches the synthetic inverted-U sign; disjunction-ON beats commit-to-singleton; and the gain is reader-agnostic at matched recall+rho. DISCONFIRM lines: (REAL-TEXT) NEITHER a singleton-resolution advantage over PoT/voting NOR a hallucination-rate drop vs raw LLM exists on the deduction-required multi-path-with-bite subset even when sound sets are sub-universal and bite exists; (ITERATION) the full-minus-naive gap is ~0 even on multi-hop/cyclic queries (the win is 'any intersection,' not iteration); (REDUNDANCY) the SINGLE genuine disconfirmer -- the ABSENCE of any net-positive redundancy region beating BOTH best-single-path and naive-intersection (a flat/turned-over curve ALONE is NOT a disconfirmation); or T0 shows NO corpus clears the applicability NUMBER (then honestly scoped to synthetic + niche-safety-net).

  PRE-REGISTERED FAILURE MODES (each a publishable scope boundary): [NEAR-UNIVERSAL UNDER-SPECIFICATION | precondition: sets effectively universal | bound: Mode A inert, intersection cannot resolve singletons | the ONLY under-specification outcome that disconfirms Mode A]. [SILENT WRONG NARROWING | precondition: a contributing set OMITS gold (unsound) | bound: rate <= (1-recall) per-edge and (1 - J(E)) per-network | suppressed by the recall-floor gate, which also shifts the redundancy peak]. [CONSISTENT-BUT-WRONG ELICITED TABLE | precondition: LLM supplies the composition table | bound: quantified vs gold in kinship only | shown NOT to arise in exact-table settings]. [INVISIBLE SINGLE-CHAIN HALLUCINATION | precondition: confident self-consistent single chain | bound: closure cannot see it | scopes Mode B to multi-path collapse only]. [TINY/CIRCULAR ENVELOPE | precondition: N* below the applicability NUMBER even on the dense corpus, or gold purely-timeline-implied with no non-circular replication on TDDMan | bound: contribution scoped to synthetic + niche safety-net | decided a-priori by T0, not after spend]. Throughout, 'zero false-positive' is stated separately for Mode A (intersected set still contains gold under JOINT-sound inputs, audited against EMPIRICAL J(E)) and Mode B (DETECTION only); the closure-detectable hallucination rate is a LOWER BOUND because PC is incomplete for Allen IA/RCC-8 (complete only on the NarrativeTime start-point convex-point-algebra arm). Atomic extraction P/R must remain comparable to baselines, the per-corpus fractions (including a-priori N* and the >=3-edge/cyclic prevalence) must be reported up front, and trace-graphs must be judged human-auditable.

  NarrativeTime / TimeBankNT (Rogers et al., LREC-COLING 2024; arXiv:1908.11443): the FIRST timeline-based annotation achieving
  FULL coverage of all possible TLinks, a human re-annotation of TimeBank-Dense (news) with IAA Krippendorff alpha ~0.68 and
  significantly higher density, plus tools converting to TimeML. We USE it as the dense real-text CO-PRIMARY because (unlike
  MATRES) it has direct human gold for NON-LOCAL pairs and (unlike TimeBank-Dense) its dense relations are HUMAN-timeline-backed
  rather than SputLink-inferred. Difference from our work: NarrativeTime is a DATASET/annotation scheme producing a single
  consistent labeling for extraction evaluation; it neither preserves LLM disjunction, intersects compositions across paths,
  certifies reading errors, nor abstains. We restrict its start-points to the convex point algebra (PC COMPLETE) and audit
  the locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied fraction to neutralise residual circularity.

  from existing annotations,' doubling TimeBank-Dense's links; relation set {before, after, simultaneous, includes, is_included},
  mutually exclusive, no VAGUE. We USE TDDMan as the NON-CIRCULARITY anchor: its gold is provably NOT the output of the closure
  algorithm we test, so a Mode-A narrowing win there cannot be a closure artifact. Difference: TDDiscourse is a benchmark
  for committed single-label discourse-level extraction; it preserves no disjunction, performs no cross-path intersection,

  MOST RECENT directly-relevant prior art. Difference: it COMMITS to a single deterministic label per pair, preserves NO disjunction,

  it enforces consistency under the F1-maximizing COMMIT contract (which it shows fails); no closure-as-CERTIFICATE, no preserved

  maximise F1 (not recall-oriented soundness); it carries no set through an EXACT composition table across MULTIPLE paths,
  performs no cross-path intersection, issues no certificate, does not abstain. We use it as an ALTERNATIVE EDGE-READER into
  the SAME closure pipeline (Tier-2) at MATCHED per-edge recall with reported rho, to show the cross-path-closure gain is

  labeling; SputLink computes closure to DENSIFY TimeBank. Differences: all COMMIT to one relation per pair for F1, use learned/approximate
  inference, and (for SputLink) produce the very non-adjacent gold whose circularity we AVOID by using NarrativeTime's direct
  human-timeline gold and TDDMan's manual non-auto-inferable gold; we PRESERVE disjunction, NARROW by exact-table cross-path

  DSR-LM / 'LLMs can Learn Rules' (Yang et al. 2023, arXiv:2305.03742; Zhu et al. 2023, arXiv:2310.07064): INDUCE weighted/symbolic
  composition rules to fit task accuracy. Difference: rule induction optimises data fit and gives a point answer; we enforce
  the EXACT ALGEBRAIC LAWS (converse, associativity, disjointness) necessary for soundness independent of training data, and
  use closure for zero-FP narrowing, detection, repair, and abstention. Our table-held-fixed closure ON-vs-OFF ablation isolates
  path-consistency from 'a fixed consistent table exists' (DSR-LM's contribution).

  Logic-LM (Pan et al. 2023, arXiv:2305.12295) and LINC (Olausson et al. 2023, arXiv:2310.15164): Logic-LM self-refines using
  solver crash/unsat messages; LINC majority-votes the answers of multiple formalisations. Difference: Logic-LM reacts only
  to crashes and has no positive global INVARIANT over relational knowledge; LINC's answer-level voting cannot see that individually-popular
  composition steps are JOINTLY inconsistent, nor tighten a disjunctive query by intersection. Algebraic closure is a global
  necessary condition both lack; we give LINC vote-agreement as a matched abstention signal.
- >-
  LAMBADA (Kazemi et al. 2023, arXiv:2212.13894) and path-isolation reasoning: backward chaining / per-path reasoning that
  manages inconsistency by COMPOSITIONAL ISOLATION rather than global enforcement. Difference: we INTERSECT across paths via
  closure, which both tightens disjunctions (Mode A) and detects contradictions (Mode B); isolation can return mutually inconsistent
  answers and cannot resolve disjunctive uncertainty.
- >-
  Logically Consistent Language Models / LOCO-LMs (Calanzone, Teso & Vergari 2024, arXiv:2409.13724; ICLR 2025): a TRAINING-TIME
  neuro-symbolic loss fine-tuning an LLM to be consistent with propositional facts/rules. Difference: it is training-time
  and PROPOSITIONAL; we are training-free at INFERENCE time and enforce multi-hop COMPOSITION closure over a RELATION ALGEBRA
  read off text, producing per-instance certificates, abstention, and trace-graphs.

  Generic LLM selective prediction / abstention, incl. temporal QA (SelectLLM 2025; abstention surveys 2025; 'When Silence
  Is Golden: Can LLMs Learn to Abstain in Temporal QA' arXiv:2602.04755): reduce error by abstaining via learned uncertainty,
  vote margins, or RL with abstention-aware rewards. Difference: abstention is driven by GENERIC confidence/uncertainty signals
  or learned at the QA-answer level; there is no algebraic consistency certificate, no per-edge reading-error localisation,
  no preserved relation-algebra disjunction, and no closure-based narrowing. Ours abstains precisely because deductive closure
  leaves the query a disjunction -- a structural, training-free, per-edge certificate.
- >-
  Classical qualitative reasoners and tractability theory: GQR, SparQ, Allen (1983), Mackworth (1977, path-consistency PC-1/PC-2
  ITERATED to a fixpoint -- distinguishing full closure from a single intersection pass, exploited in our naive-intersection
  ablation), Renz & Nebel (random network model A(n,d,l)), Vilain & Kautz 1986 (point algebra), Nebel & Burckert 1995 (ORD-Horn,
  JACM 42(1)). So PC is COMPLETE for the convex point algebra and ORD-Horn yet SOUND-BUT-INCOMPLETE for full Allen IA / RCC-8.
  Difference: these assume a clean human-given table on already-formal data; none read the algebra off NL via an LLM, certify
  reading errors, narrow by cross-path intersection of LLM disjunctions, model an EMPIRICALLY-audited recall-bounded redundancy
  OPTIMUM, or optimise risk-coverage.
inspiration: >-
  A Level-3 (methodological) cross-domain transfer from Qualitative Spatial-Temporal Reasoning and Tarski's relation algebras
  -- Allen's interval algebra, RCC-8, the convex point algebra, composition tables, and the path-consistency / algebraic-closure
  constraint-propagation algorithms (GQR/SparQ; Mackworth's iterated PC), plus the tractability theory (point-algebra and
  ORD-Horn completeness vs full-Allen NP-completeness) -- imported into LLM-based relational reasoning and hallucination control,
  with Reiter's 1980s model-based diagnosis (minimal hitting sets of conflict sets) for localising which extracted atom to
  retract. The Level-1 framing is CODING THEORY: an exact composition table turns multi-path redundancy in a document into
  an error-correcting code over LLM extractions -- redundant constraining paths let closure DETECT and CORRECT mis-reads with
  no external labels, as parity checks detect bit errors. The coding-theory 'optimal rate' sharpening (net benefit is an INVERTED-U
  because narrowing stays zero-FP only while every contributing symbol is sound) is made RIGOROUS: the joint-soundness 'decoding
  margin' is MEASURED empirically as J(E) rather than assumed as the independence product r^E, since a single LLM reader produces
  positively-correlated reading errors -- so the predicted peak uses the measured channel correlation. The Level-2 framing
  is SELECTIVE PREDICTION / risk-coverage in ML: compare an abstaining method against non-abstaining baselines at MATCHED
  COVERAGE with a shared coverage object and report the ACTIONABLE (singleton-resolution-to-correct) yield AND the downstream
  hallucination-rate reduction. Two refinements drive THIS iteration. (a) CORPUS SELECTION AS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: a mechanism's
  claim must live on a corpus that can structurally host it -- since MATRES annotates only adjacent-sentence pairs its deduction-required
  envelope is empty by construction, so the headline is relocated to a DENSE, full-coverage, direct-human-gold corpus (NarrativeTime)
  and corroborated where gold is provably non-closure-derived (TDDMan), with MATRES retained as a control that proves the
  gate discriminates. (b) ARM SCOPING borrowed from the discipline of stating where a mechanism's advantage must and must
  not appear: iterated closure provably equals a single intersection pass on acyclic length-2 structures, so the iteration
  win is claimed only on >=3-edge/cyclic structures -- now found on BOTH synthetic networks and the dense corpus's real long-hop
  stratum, dissolving the prior internal contradiction without confining the win to synthetic data. Three cross-field insights
  anchor the design: (1) LLMs are competent LOCAL qualitative namers that do NOT propagate constraints across paths -- the
  missing piece is global ITERATED propagation, and cross-path INTERSECTION of sound sets is a zero-FP win needing no over-commitment;
  (2) because the table is mathematical ground truth, intersection-of-sound-sets can only move toward gold and collapse-of-unsound-sets
  is a calibration-free certificate -- flipping the objective from accuracy-by-committing (ILP global inference, whose own
  results show consistency-enforcement does not raise F1) to faithfulness-by-abstaining; (3) the coding-theory lens names
  BOTH the safe primary mode (erasure-style narrowing) and the Achilles heel (a recall-bounded decoding radius whose EMPIRICAL
  joint-soundness decay produces an inverted-U), elevated to a pre-registered, decomposed, estimation-precision-bounded prediction
  anchored on both synthetic and real text.
terms:
- term: Dense direct-human-gold CO-PRIMARY (NarrativeTime / TimeBankNT)
  definition: >-
    The relocated real-text headline host: a timeline-based, FULL-TLink-coverage human re-annotation of TimeBank-Dense (news),
    IAA Krippendorff alpha ~0.68. Its density supplies abundant multi-path and >=3-edge/cyclic constraint structures (hosting
    both narrowing and a real-text iteration demonstration); its start-point restriction lands in the convex point algebra
    (PC COMPLETE); and its non-local gold is HUMAN-timeline-placed, not algorithmic-closure output, so closure recovery is
    non-circular. Replaces MATRES as primary because MATRES annotates only adjacent-sentence pairs.
- term: Gate-validation control (MATRES)
  definition: >-
    MATRES is retained but repositioned: because it annotates ONLY same/adjacent-sentence event pairs, every gold edge is
    locally co-occurring (directly-readable), so its deduction-required multi-path-with-bite envelope is structurally near-EMPTY
    and T0's N* ~ 0 by construction. Reporting this N* ~ 0 alongside NarrativeTime/TDDMan N* >> 0 demonstrates the deduction-required
    gate is DISCRIMINATIVE rather than vacuous.
- term: Non-circularity anchor (TDDMan)
  definition: >-
    The manually-annotated long-distance (>1-sentence-apart) subset of TDDiscourse whose pairs 'cannot be inferred automatically
    from existing annotations' -- so its gold is provably NOT the output of the closure algorithm under test. A Mode-A narrowing
    win on TDDMan therefore cannot be a closure artifact, bounding the residual timeline-implied-circularity worry about NarrativeTime
    by empirical replication rather than assertion. Relation set {before, after, simultaneous, includes, is_included}, coarse
    interval algebra.
- term: Non-circularity audit (locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied)
  definition: >-
    For NarrativeTime, a partition of held-out edges into LOCALLY-JUSTIFIABLE (a textual cue near both events that the local-only
    reader can exploit) versus PURELY-TIMELINE-IMPLIED (no local cue; gold obtainable only from the human's holistic timeline).
    The deduction-required headline subset is the latter; because its gold is human-timeline placement (not algorithmic PC),
    recovering it by closure over independently LLM-read edges uses a DIFFERENT inference process and is non-circular. The
    fraction is reported up front.
- term: End-to-end hallucination-reduction headline (H2)
  definition: >-
    Promoted from a Tier-2 echo to a co-headline because it is the umbrella pipeline's actual deliverable: on the deduction-required
    / absent-relation subset, the closure pipeline's CONFIDENT-WRONG (non-abstained gold-mismatch) rate is lower than a raw
    LLM forced to a single relation, by at least a PRE-REGISTERED minimum effect, adjusted-CI-separated. A gateway test of
    the confirmatory family.
- term: Real-text iteration stratum (H3 on real text)
  definition: >-
    The dense corpus's >=3-edge/cyclic constraint structures, whose prevalence T0 computes a-priori (zero LLM spend). Length-2
    real queries still tie naive intersection (as predicted), but on this stratum full ITERATED closure can beat naive single-pass
    intersection -- bringing part of the iteration win onto real text instead of confining it to synthetic networks. If the
    stratum is empty/tiny, the iteration claim honestly stays synthetic-only.
- term: Applicability-envelope threshold (concrete number)
  definition: >-
    The pre-registered NUMBER distinguishing a 'general mechanism' from a 'niche safety-net': the deduction-required multi-path-with-bite
    fraction of evaluable held-out edges is scored >=10% = general mechanism, 5-10% = useful module, <5% = niche safety-net.
    Fixed before any LLM spend and reported from T0, so the contribution's reach is declared, not argued post-hoc.
- term: Multiplicity policy (confirmatory vs exploratory)
  definition: >-
    A pre-registered stance against the garden-of-forking-paths objection: the CONFIRMATORY family is H1 (narrowing), H2 (hallucination
    reduction), H3 (iteration gap grows), H4 (redundancy inverted-U disconfirmer), tested with Holm-Bonferroni / hierarchical
    gatekeeping (H1/H2 gateways) and ADJUSTED CIs; all strata, per-bin curves, reader-agnosticity, Mode-B, and secondary corpora
    are EXPLORATORY with nominal CIs.
- term: Recall-and-rho-matched reader-agnosticity
  definition: >-
    The protocol for the alternative-edge-reader test: each reader (METRE-style trained multi-label head; a second LLM/prompt
    family) is tuned to a MATCHED per-edge recall AND its measured cross-edge error correlation rho is reported, with the
    agnosticity verdict interpreted conditional on BOTH (conditioning on rho if it differs materially). Prevents 'the win
    is in the algebra' from being confounded by a reader whose F1-oriented training gives the same recall but different error
    correlation.
- term: Empirical joint soundness J(E)
  definition: >-
    The realized fraction of E-edge constraining subnetworks in which ALL edges are sound, MEASURED directly from data, replacing
    the independence product prod_e r_e. The zero-FP audit's reliability curve is pre-registered against J(E); the inverted-U
    cost term is 1 - J(E); positive cross-edge correlation rho makes J(E) decay slower than r^E so the predicted peak sits
    further out than an independence model says.
- term: Sound narrowing (Mode A, primary)
  definition: >-
    The zero-false-positive value mode: when every contributing LLM edge set is SOUND (contains its gold relation) but sub-universal,
    intersecting the compositions arriving at a query pair from MULTIPLE non-universal paths yields a set that still contains
    gold yet is strictly tighter than any single path. Requires breadth + multi-path bite, NOT over-commitment; its zero-FP
    guarantee SURVIVES PC incompleteness; inert only in the degenerate all-universal limit.
- term: Singleton-resolution-to-correct yield (headline metric)
  definition: >-
    The load-bearing Mode-A metric: the fraction of multi-path SOUND-input query pairs whose cross-path intersection collapses
    the query to the single CORRECT relation. Distinguished from STRICT-TIGHTENING yield (any reduction), which does NOT move
    matched-coverage selective accuracy nor the hallucination-rate metric. Both reported; singleton-resolution is load-bearing.
- term: Inverted-U redundancy optimum
  definition: >-
    Net Mode-A selective-accuracy gain RISES then FALLS as path redundancy/hop-count increases at fixed per-edge recall: more
    paths add narrowing benefit, but each added contributing edge lowers empirical joint soundness J(E), so silent-narrowing
    cost (1 - J(E)) eventually dominates. Peak location increases with recall; the recall-floor gate shifts it outward. Established
    only at a pre-registered estimation precision; otherwise reported as 'directionally consistent.'
- term: Naive-intersection baseline
  definition: >-
    Intersect the compositions arriving at the query pair in a SINGLE pass, without iterating to a fixpoint and without algebra-seeded
    converse propagation -- i.e. 'Path-of-Thoughts plus one obvious intersection step.' It COINCIDES with full closure on
    length-2 multi-path queries (so Mode A is predicted to TIE it on the real-text length-2 stratum) but diverges on longer/cyclic
    networks, where the full-minus-naive gap GROWS -- the iteration claim, tested on synthetic AND the real >=3-edge/cyclic
    stratum.
- term: Detection/repair (Mode B, secondary)
  definition: >-
    The collapse-based value mode: an empty closure certifies that some LLM edge is UNSOUND -- a gold-free zero-FP DETECTION
    flag (conditional on recall). Requires at least one over-committed/recall-failed edge to fire, supports Reiter-style minimal-hitting-set
    localisation/repair (which can mislocalise), and carries the silent-wrong-narrowing dual. Reported distinctly from Mode
    A; magnitude tracks the measured over-commitment rate.
- term: Recall-bite frontier
  definition: >-
    The curve, traced by sweeping the prompt-elicited breadth knob from 'name the relation' to 'name the maximal sound set,'
    of per-edge recall against singleton-resolution-to-correct yield and collapse rate. Recall and bite are in direct tension
    on the SAME knob, so a single operating point cannot establish viability; we map the frontier and pre-register that the
    main run proceeds only if a region clears a recall gate AND yields non-trivial singleton-resolution-to-correct.
- term: Deduction-required vs directly-readable stratification
  definition: >-
    A LOCAL-ONLY READER probe predicts each held-out edge from ONLY the minimal local span(s) where its two events co-occur
    (or flags 'no shared span'). Edges it confidently and correctly names are DIRECTLY-READABLE; the rest are DEDUCTION-REQUIRED
    (obtainable only by composing >=2 edges). We foreground the deduction-required fraction, stratify the headline by it,
    and draw the primary subset preferentially from deduction-required triangles. The T0 gate uses a structural proxy (no
    shared local span) computable without the LLM.
- term: Convex point algebra (NarrativeTime start-point arm)
  definition: >-
    The relation algebra over a single time point per event with convex base relations <=, =, >= (and disjunctions). NarrativeTime's
    timeline yields start-points whose ordering instantiates this algebra, for which path-consistency is provably COMPLETE
    and the table exact. We widen non-convex {<,>} (genuine !=) to VAGUE to preserve completeness and MEASURE the bite lost;
    if non-trivial we add a full-interval Allen arm scored as a lower-bound detector.
- term: Silent wrong narrowing (pre-registered failure mode)
  definition: >-
    When a contributing set OMITS gold (unsound), closure can narrow the query to a confident WRONG singleton with NO empty
    collapse -- a certified-LOOKING hallucination the mechanism actively endorses. Its rate is bounded per-edge by (1-recall)
    and per-network by (1 - J(E)); reported in the decomposition of gold-wrong non-abstained predictions; the recall-floor
    gate is tested as a mitigation and as the lever that shifts the inverted-U redundancy peak.
- term: Matched-coverage selective comparison
  definition: >-
    The protocol for comparing an abstaining method against baselines: each baseline is given its own abstention/confidence
    signal (vote margin, verbalised confidence, vote agreement, path-agreement), thresholds are swept so every method reports
    at the SAME coverage using the SAME coverage object (single-relation resolution), and selective accuracy is compared with
    paired-bootstrap CIs -- preventing the headline from conflating 'closure' with 'closure has a better-calibrated abstain.'
- term: Trace-graph
  definition: >-
    A human-auditable record: the QCN, which composition entries fired on which paths during closure, any minimal repairs,
    and optionally an equivalent SWI-Prolog/ASP proof discharged from the closed table for replay -- the connective tissue
    to the umbrella text-to-logic pipeline's auditability and quantified-hallucination-reduction requirements.
summary: >-
  We import exact relation-algebra path consistency (Allen interval, convex point algebra, RCC-8) into the deduction module
  of a text-to-logic pipeline and -- fixing the prior version's fatal corpus choice -- relocate the real-text headline from
  MATRES (adjacent-sentence-only, deduction-required envelope empty by construction) to a DENSE direct-human-gold corpus (NarrativeTime,
  full TLink coverage, human-timeline gold), corroborated on TDDMan whose gold is provably non-closure-derived: cross-path
  SOUND NARROWING of the LLM's high-recall disjunctive sets beats path-isolated reasoning and voting at matched coverage AND
  cuts the hallucination rate versus a raw LLM, while iterated closure beats naive single-pass intersection on long-hop/cyclic
  structures both synthetic AND real, and the recall-bounded inverted-U redundancy optimum is audited via empirical joint
  soundness J(E). An a-priori, zero-LLM-spend envelope gate (with a concrete applicability threshold), a confirmatory-vs-exploratory
  multiplicity policy, and recall-and-rho-matched reader-agnosticity make every headline falsifiable before any model is called.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same closure frame; value relocated to local-reader regime + committed end-to-end Prolog slice after real-text NO-GO
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Relocated the real-text value claim from dense-timeline narrowing to the LOCAL-reader regime, since iter-1 showed closure~=full-context
  reader (delta<=0) and local reads pin gold only 26.7%; the head-to-head is now closure-over-local-reads vs {local raw LLM,
  PoT, voting}, never vs a full-context oracle.
- >-
  Promoted the END-TO-END deliverable (emit Prolog/ASP, discharge in SWI-Prolog, report an ACTUAL hallucination-rate reduction)
  to a headline and added CLUTRR as the clean end-to-end venue delivering atomic P/R + multi-hop accuracy + trace-graph +
  hallucination number at once -- addressing the project-goal disconnect.
- >-
  Required actually RUNNING the seven enumerated baselines at matched coverage (synthetic backbone + local-reader real slice);
  unrun baselines are removed, not promised, fixing the unsupported central comparative claim.
- >-
  Qualified the certificate everywhere as 'zero-FP CONDITIONAL ON READ-SOUNDNESS', required reporting silent-wrong rate vs
  per-edge recall, and explicitly tagged theorems/sanity-checks (zero-FP invariant, N*=25,450 recovery, gate discriminativeness)
  vs genuine empirical findings.
- >-
  Un-conflated NarrativeTime (gate applicability 0.882) from the TimeBank-Dense stand-in actually read (0.039); require reads
  on the actual NarrativeTime gold, >=10x deduction-triangle samples with CIs, and >=2 readers including a substantially stronger
  model.
- >-
  Relocated the iteration claim off the dense timeline (full_only=0, recovery guaranteed) onto TDDMan (full_only=12, the genuine
  signal) + synthetic long-hop.
- >-
  Flagged the synthetic realism breach (TV=0.25 vs pre-registered <=0.10) and the identical-recall breadth knob (0.958 across
  S1-S5); require a realism-matched channel with a knob that genuinely trades recall for bite, or an explicit downgrade to
  'idealized channel'.
- >-
  Corrected the Page p-value (1.2e-4, not 1e-13) and required per-recall-slice reporting of the iteration gap (0.99 at recall~1.0
  vs 0.63 at recall 0.90).
- >-
  Tempered generality to convex-point (exact) + Allen (lower bound) + kinship composition (end-to-end); RCC-8 real-text and
  spatial/legal framing made optional/removed unless an arm is executed.
- >-
  Sharpened the novelty statement (the new piece is the output contract + certificate + coding-rate framing, NOT the algebra)
  and required citing recent LLM temporal-consistency work; added a worked-example + notation-table requirement for clarity.

  Implementation/Resource Dossier for the Closure-Certified Text-to-Logic Deduction Module
summary: >-
  Verified, executor-ready specifications for the closure-certified temporal-deduction pipeline: (1) corpus access+parse formats
  for NarrativeTime (repo github.com/text-machine-lab/nt, MIT, nt_format JSONL with per-event numeric `time` coordinate +
  bracket-type interval model + same-branch get_event_relation), TDDMan (4-col TSV, codes a/b/i/ii/s, join text from TimeBank-Dense;

  (2) machine-readable GQR composition/converse tables for Allen (13 tokens with < / > for before/after), convex point algebra
  (with the only-non-convex != -> universal widening rule), and RCC-8, each with verified unit-test cells; (3) Mackworth PC-2
  iterated a-closure pseudocode + the precise naive single-pass-intersection contrast (naive==full on length-2, diverges at
  hop>=3 / cyclomatic>=1) + soundness/completeness tractability facts (point-algebra arm EXACT, full Allen/RCC-8 a LOWER BOUND);
  (4) the Renz-Nebel A(n,d,l) model plus the scenario-then-abstract recipe for guaranteed-consistent synthetic QCNs with independent
  density/hop/cyclomatic/recall knobs; (5) baseline configs each with a matched abstention signal (Path-of-Thoughts, self-consistency,

title: 'Fold-split gold temporal relation graphs: NarrativeTime, TDDMan, MATRES'
summary: |-
  Frozen, reusable real-text gold temporal relation graphs that all downstream real-text closure experiments (the T0 envelope go/no-go pilot now; later arms) consume. Schema exp_sel_data_out, grouped by dataset, ONE example per (corpus, document) row (345 examples): input = the stripped document text (string), output = json.dumps(gold_graph) (string; parse with json.loads). The gold_graph has nodes [{node_id, node_type in {event,timex,dct}, surface, char_start, char_end, global_token_index, sentence_index, eiid/tid/eid, event_class, plus nt_event_type/nt_time/nt_branch/nt_start/nt_end for NarrativeTime}] and edges [{source, target, native_relation, canonical_algebra, canonical_relation_set, coarse_superset_set?, startpoint_relation_set, vague_widened, src/tgt_sentence_index, sentence_distance, locality_class in {intra,adjacent,long_distance}, structural_deduction_required_proxy (dist>=2), locally_justifiable_proxy (dist<=1), edge_fold, phenomena?}], plus per_doc_descriptive_counts. Each example also carries metadata_corpus/doc_id/fold/n_nodes/n_edges/n_events/long_distance_edges/descriptive_counts.

  Three corpora by role: (1) NarrativeTime (36 docs, 1,715 events, 103,748 edges, dense full TLink coverage, 1.58M event-event triangles) is the DENSE headline host; relations are produced by the corpus authors' OWN code (narrative_time.event_relations + conversion_utils), reproducing the shipped nt_converted_to_tml TLINKs EXACTLY (blocking gate: 207,496 relation-multisets + node counts match across all 36 docs) — non-circular gold; canonical_algebra=interval_allen with start-point point relations, non-convex {<,>} widened to {<,=,>} (vague_widened, 124 edges). (2) TDDMan (34 docs, 6,137 manually-annotated event-event pairs, 99.9% long-distance >=2 sentences apart) is the non-circularity anchor; codes {b,a,s,i,ii} mapped to tightest Allen + coarse superset + convex point sets; 107 test pairs carry TDDiscourse phenomena tags. (3) MATRES (275 docs, 6,099 events, 13,577 edges, 0% long-distance: 30% intra / 70% adjacent) is the gate-validation control with a near-empty deduction envelope; point algebra (BEFORE/AFTER/EQUAL/VAGUE -> {<}/{>}/{=}/{<,=,>}, no non-convex relations).

  Folds: document-level TimeBank-Dense 22/5/9 train/dev/test for NarrativeTime/TDDMan; MATRES train(TimeBank+AQUAINT)/test(Platinum); TDDMan edges also carry native edge_fold. One frozen NLTK Punkt sentence segmentation is reused across NarrativeTime/TDDMan; MATRES uses the canonical qiangning per-token sentence ids with SENTDIFF as authoritative distance. A doc-id overlap table (overlap_table.json) shows 33 documents shared by all three corpora. Aggregate + per-document DESCRIPTIVE structural counts (sizes, native/canonical label distributions, locality distribution, triangles, >=2-intermediate query edges, cyclomatic number, >=3-hop pairs) are in descriptive_counts.json. The gated statistics (deduction-required N*, bite-after-widening, singleton-resolution) are intentionally NOT computed here — they need composition closure / held-out-edge resolution and are the T0 experiment's job. Caveats: 1 TDDMan eid absent from the muk343 .tml version (APW19980213.1310/e257, 13 pairs dropped, reported in metadata.coverage_gaps); 238/6,099 MATRES events (3.9%) lack a char offset (boundary edge cases) but retain sentence_index + global_token_index; every non-null MATRES offset is surface-exact by construction; NarrativeTime gold uses annotator a1. Sources cited in README.md and metadata.sources (CogComp MATRES, qiangning EMNLP19 XML, TDDiscourse, text-machine-lab narrative_time, muk343 TimeBank-Dense, TempEval-3 TBAQ-cleaned). Reproduce via data.py / build_dataset.py with pinned pyproject.toml. An optional 4th TimeBank-Dense corpus builder is available (builders.build_timebank_dense) but not emitted.

  Synthetic QCN Backbone: consistent Allen/Point/RCC-8 networks with NL realizations
summary: |-
  Clean-ground-truth SYNTHETIC backbone for the redundancy (H4) and iteration (H3) claims: 35,100 globally-consistent Qualitative Constraint Networks over three relation algebras -- convex Point ('<','=','>') and Allen Interval (13 relations) as PRIMARY (500 networks/cell), RCC-8 (8 relations) as SECONDARY (300/cell). Every network is built by model-based realization (integer points / integer-grid intervals / collinear integer discs), so the gold ATOMIC relation on each edge is read exactly off the model and the whole scenario is globally consistent BY CONSTRUCTION (no solver needed). Composition + converse come from the authoritative alreich/qualreas tables, independently cross-checked by 436 tests (Allen composition matches exhaustive endpoint-CSP enumeration; RCC-8 reader sound vs disc enumeration; relation-algebra identity/converse axioms).

  Each network has a held-out query pair (s,t) that shares no edge and never co-occurs in one sentence -- DEDUCTION-REQUIRED: the query relation is obtainable only by composing >=1 multi-edge path. Topology is independently swept across 27 cells per algebra: redundancy P in {1,2,3,4,6,8}; hop L in {2,3,4,5}; cyclomatic mu in {0,1,2,3} via chord augmentation; small/medium/large node-count regimes; and random Renz-Nebel A(n,d) for the natural joint distribution. The intended structural signal is clean (results/dataset_metadata.json -> cell_summary): singleton-resolution rises monotonically with redundancy P (allen 0.40->0.89), bite decays with hop length, cyclomatic augmentation adds paths.

  Output is the aii exp_sel_data_out schema with 3 datasets (synthetic_qcn_point / synthetic_qcn_allen / synthetic_qcn_rcc8); ONE ROW = ONE network. input = template NL realization (one professional-prose sentence per non-query edge, 2-3 paraphrases per relation, + a final 'Query:' line); output = JSON string of the gold graph {edges:[{source,target,relation}], query_edge:{...,is_query:true}}. Rich metadata_* per row: fold (pilot/dev/test by md5(seed)%100 within each cell), algebra, cell labels, MEASURED structure (cyclomatic_number, cycle_basis_size, num_simple_paths_s_t, paths_truncated, contributing_edge_count, avg_degree), enumerated s-t paths with per-path gold composition + naive_intersection + has_bite + singleton_resolved, abstract_graph, entity_map, reference_disjunctive_labels (SOUND superset per edge; convex-only for point), model_embedding, seed. The CORRECTNESS GATE -- composition of gold atomic relations along every enumerated path CONTAINS the gold query relation -- passed on all 35,100 networks. Pre-registered realism thresholds (validated=false; TV<=0.15 / rho<=0.10 / EMD<=0.10) are recorded for next-iteration matching against the real-text frontier pilot.

  Files: full corpus split into full_data_out/full_data_out_1.json + full_data_out_2.json (each <100 MB; concatenate datasets with the same name across parts to reconstruct), plus mini_data_out.json (3 examples/algebra) and preview_data_out.json (10 examples/algebra, strings truncated). Generated deterministically by `uv run data.py` (~18 s on 4 cores; per (algebra, cell, index) md5 seeds, resumable). QA/provenance/dataset-card in results/dataset_metadata.json; algebra package + 436-check verification suite in qcn/ and tests/. The real-text corpora (NarrativeTime / TDDMan / MATRES) are delivered by SIBLING artifacts and are NOT duplicated here.

title: Zero-LLM T0 Envelope Gate + QCN Path-Consistency Engine over Temporal Corpora
summary: |-
  Implements and unit-validates a reusable Qualitative Constraint Network (QCN) path-consistency engine and runs the decisive zero-LLM-spend T0 envelope gate over three real temporal corpora, deciding whether (and where) a real-text headline is viable before iter-2 spends any LLM budget.

  ENGINE (engine.py): bitmask-encoded Algebra (Allen-13, convex Linear Point, RCC-8) loaded from authoritative qualreas tables (bundled in algebras/ for self-containment), a QCN, and THREE instrumented closure variants used as METHOD vs BASELINES in one pipeline: pc2_full = FULL iterated Mackworth PC-2 to fixpoint (OUR METHOD); naive_single_pass = single pass of length-2 intersections at the query edge (BASELINE, Path-of-Thoughts-style); closure_off = no propagation (lower baseline). Predictions appear per example as predict_our_method_full_pc / predict_baseline_naive_singlepass / predict_baseline_closure_off, with gold as output.

  ENGINE VALIDATION (tests.py, gates everything, ALL PASS): Allen 169-cell table validated against published Allen-1983 canonical cells + the composition-converse algebra law on all 169 cells + converse involution + identity; convex point COMPLETENESS confirmed vs brute-force enumeration (0 label/consistency mismatches over 200 random nets) => point arm is EXACT; A<B<C<A detected inconsistent; iteration isolation (FULL==NAIVE on a length-2 query, FULL!=NAIVE on a 3-hop chain).

  CORPORA (parsers.py, gold only, cached to cache/ for iter-2 reuse): MATRES (CogComp txt + qiangning EMNLP-19 sentence alignment) -> convex point on start-points; 100% of pairs are same/adjacent sentence (SENTDIFF in {0,1}). TDDMan (TDDiscourse tsv, strict Allen map + broad sensitivity) -> all pairs deduction-required by construction (non-circularity anchor). NarrativeTime (text-machine-lab annotator a1 timeline coords) -> dense full-coverage point gold + Allen interval arm.

  T0 FUNNEL + RESULTS (method.py -> method_out.json, exp_gen_sol_out schema-VALID): per held-out edge funnel evaluable -> (i) deduction-required -> (ii) multi-path -> (iii) bite-after-widening -> (iv) N* exact recovery, plus the >=3-edge/cyclic iteration envelope (full_only), widening bite-loss, paired-bootstrap power + faithful normal-approx MDE at true N, and the NarrativeTime locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied split. Findings: MATRES N*=0 (control; gate discriminative). TDDMan applicability 0.085 (module band; 0.104 broad), N*=408, full_only=12 -> genuine iterated-PC advantage on sparse manual long-distance gold; Allen recovery is a sound LOWER BOUND. NarrativeTime applicability 0.882 (general band), N*=25450 recovered EXACTLY, but full_only=0 because the dense timeline is near-transitively-closed so single-pass already has direct evidence (iteration ties single-pass on dense gold; 88.6% of edges purely-timeline-implied). Power: both real arms clear the pre-registered min effect 0.10 with power>=0.80 (NarrativeTime true-N MDE 0.05). A complete-graph fast path (full-PC == single-pass on complete graphs) was VERIFIED against genuine PC on 1095 cross-checks (0 mismatches), keeping runtime ~60s.

  VERDICT (hosting_decision.verdict_text): GO -> host the real-text headline on NarrativeTime; TDDMan is the non-circular corroboration arm; MATRES is the N*~0 control. This matches the pre-registered arm-scope: the certificate beats closure-off broadly, but iterated>single-pass only on SPARSE long-hop gold (TDDMan), not on dense timelines. Deliverables: engine.py, tests.py, parsers.py, method.py, bundled algebras/, reusable cache/, README.md, and full/mini/preview method_out JSON.

title: Synthetic QCN de-risking of iterated closure (H3) and redundancy inverted-U (H4)
summary: |-
  This experiment de-risks two mechanism claims for neuro-symbolic text->logic pipelines on clean synthetic ground truth, with ZERO LLM spend. It generates consistent-by-construction Qualitative Constraint Networks (QCNs) by realization off a sampled point assignment, and simulates the LLM reader as an exactly-controlled noisy channel with three knobs: per-edge recall r (P(gold in emitted set)), a sub-universal breadth distribution, and a within-network cross-edge soundness correlation rho (latent equicorrelated Gaussian). PRIMARY algebra = the convex point algebra ({<,=,>}; path-consistency provably COMPLETE), matching the NarrativeTime start-point arm; an optional Allen interval generality arm derives the 13x13 composition table from endpoint point-relations and self-verifies it.

  METHOD vs BASELINES run side-by-side in one pipeline: FULL iterated path-consistency closure (our method) vs NAIVE single-pass query-node intersection and OFF direct-read (baselines). Mode-A answers are singleton resolutions; each is classified CORRECT / WRONG (silent narrowing) / ABSTAIN / COLLAPSE (detected contradiction = the Mode-B certificate firing).

  RESULTS at the pre-registered full scale (N=600/cell, B_BOOT=2000, 378 cells, fully deterministic, ~60s on 4 cores) -- all three hypotheses PASS:
  - H3 (iteration > naive): FULL-minus-NAIVE selective-accuracy gap is 0.0 at hop-length L=2 (structural tie, CI includes 0) and grows monotonically to 0.99 at L=6 (3/3 ordered-trend tests: Page p~1e-13, Spearman bootstrap CI [0.9,1.0], hand-rolled Jonckheere p~0); the gap also rises with cyclomatic number (0.73->0.87 over 0..3 chords). Mechanism: longer/denser chains give iteration more tight-edge anchors that single-pass intersection cannot reach.
  - H4 (recall-dependent redundancy inverted-U): the Mode-A resolution rate P(CORRECT) is an inverted-U in redundancy K; the optimum K* moves OUTWARD with recall (peak K = 2,4,5,5,8 across r=0.5..0.95) and under the recall-floor gate; under positive rho the empirically MEASURED joint soundness J(E) exceeds the r^E independence model, pushing the optimum further out (low-recall benefit-centroid shift +0.95). Crucially the redundancy downside manifests as DETECTED collapse, not silent error.
  - C3 (zero false-positive certificate): among networks whose contributing edges are all sound, P(gold in Mode-A output) = 1.0 EXACTLY (soundness invariant of path-consistency); collapse never co-occurs with all-sound; overall silent-WRONG rate is only 5.8%; unsound networks decompose into 40% absorbed-correct / 38% detected-collapse / 11% abstain / 11% silent-wrong. The pre-registered contains-gold-vs-J(E) slope~1 is NOT met (slope 0.66) -- reported honestly -- because the convex algebra absorbs most single unsound reads, so retention OVER-delivers versus joint soundness (a stronger-than-predicted certificate).
  - Allen generality arm (exploratory): 13x13 table self-verified against canonical entries (o.o={p,m,o}, d.d={d}, p.P=universal, equals=identity); the resolution inverted-U and the zero-FP certificate both replicate; collapse rates are reported as a LOWER BOUND since PC is sound-but-incomplete for full Allen (the point arm stays exact).

  DELIVERABLES: method.py (full pipeline including Stage-0 algebra self-verify and Stage-1 hand-checked toy networks), allen_arm.py, method_out.json (exp_gen_sol_out-validated; metadata holds config/seeds/breadth, per-section H3/H4/C3/modeB/Allen results, a compact summary_for_paper block, and overall_verdict; the datasets array holds 240 worked QCN query examples each carrying predict_full/predict_naive/predict_off baseline columns and metadata_* fields), four PNG figures (H3 gap-vs-L tie+growth; H4 resolution inverted-U with outward-moving peaks + channel decomposition; J(E) vs r^E; zero-FP audit), and pyproject.toml pinning numpy==2.4.6/scipy==1.17.1/matplotlib==3.11.0. Downstream paper-writing can consume metadata.summary_for_paper and the figures directly; every PASS/FAIL boolean, located peak, trend p-value, and bootstrap CI is in metadata. Verdict: H3=PASS, H4=PASS, C3=PASS.

  T0/pilot viability gate for the closure-certified temporal-composition study (does NOT run the main comparison). Self-contained
  pipeline: engine.py (POINT + Allen-13 qualitative algebras built programmatically by the endpoint method, cross-checked
  against the dossier's verified GQR composition cells; Mackworth PC-2 closure, length-2 triangle narrowing, naive-single-pass
  baseline, convex '!=' -> universal widening with counting), corpora.py (three real arms: TimeBank-Dense .tml TLINKs as the
  dense NarrativeTime stand-in [ALLEN]; TDDMan TSV joined to .tml text as the non-circular all-deduction-required arm [ALLEN];
  MATRES qiangning XML as the local gate control [POINT]), synth.py (scenario-then-abstract consistent QCNs as a clean-text

  (orchestrator). Sweeps a 5-setting breadth knob (S1_single -> S5_maximal) via google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite (the dossier's
  gemini-2.5-flash-lite is delisted) at temperature 0, measuring per-edge recall (with doc-clustered bootstrap CIs), breadth,
  error-type mix, triangle collapse rate, strict-tightening, singleton-to-correct (overall + deduction-required subset, with
  CI), an explicit method(closure)-vs-baseline(direct read) delta, within-document error correlation rho (ICC), J(2)/J(3)
  vs a matched independence baseline, a local-only-reader probe, and point-vs-Allen bite-lost. RESULT: VERDICT=NO-GO/NICHE
  -- no real arm clears the pre-registered recall gate at any knob (TBDense 0.80, MATRES 0.86, TDDMan 0.58; gates 0.85 Allen
  / 0.90 point), so real-text READ SOUNDNESS, not the closure step, is the binding constraint; the synthetic clean-text arm
  reaches recall 0.96 with closure deduction-resolution ~0.37-0.42 (>=0.10), and closure ~= direct read on full-context deduction
  edges (delta~=0). Gate validation PASSED (MATRES deduction-fraction 0.0); rho=0.10 with J(E)>r^E; bite-lost=0; local-probe
  pins gold only 27% on deduction edges. Spend $0.58 over 4191 billed calls, 0 parse failures, 0 API errors. Output method_out.json
  validates against exp_gen_sol_out (840 per-edge examples with predict_<knob> fields + a 30-field metadata block: frontier_table,
  selected/fallback operating point, rho, J_E, deduction_required_fraction, gate_validation, method_vs_baseline_deduction,
  applicability_verdict, synthetic block, provenance, figures). For iter-2: headline the synthetic arm, scope real text as
  a niche safety-net, and measure closure's value against a LOCAL-only reader (not a full-context reader). Three figures:
  frontier scatter, breadth-vs-recall, collapse-vs-knob.

summary: >-
  Executor-ready, web-verified resolution of the six NEW implementation decisions the iter-2 closure-certified text-to-logic
  experiments need (beyond the iter-1 dossier art_aQ2Rf8rwqteI). (1) LOCAL-READER PROTOCOL: minimal-span unit = the single

  window (same-sentence + immediately-following-sentence + DCT; 5 relations BEFORE/AFTER/INCLUDES/IS_INCLUDED/SIMULTANEOUS

title: 'CLUTRR kinship gold graphs: two hop-stratified slices with absent-relation pairs'
summary: |-
  The clean END-TO-END venue for the closure-certificate umbrella, beside the iter-1 temporal corpora (NarrativeTime/TDDMan/MATRES) and the synthetic-QCN backbone. Standardizes CLUTRR (Sinha et al., EMNLP 2019, arXiv:1908.06177) into the aii exp_sel_data_out schema, ONE ROW per story, so iter-3 can deliver — in ONE setting — all four numbers the umbrella names: (i) atomic-extraction precision/recall, (ii) multi-hop deduction accuracy vs chain length, (iii) a human-auditable trace-graph, and (iv) a hallucination-rate reduction on absent-relation queries.

  THE BEST 2 DATASETS (26,676 rows total; target_num_datasets=2): clutrr_gen (gen_train234_test2to10; 16,131 rows; clean; train hops 2-3-4, TEST hops 2..10 → the accuracy-vs-length curve + atomic P/R + trace-graph) and clutrr_disc (rob_train_disc_23_test_all_23; 10,545 rows; disconnected-noise → 10,244 two-component stories yielding 71,684 genuine within-document ABSENT pairs for the hallucination demo; its test split also mixes clean/supporting/irrelevant/disconnected noise, so distractor examples for P/R robustness are present without a 3rd slice). The plan's explicitly-optional 3rd slice clutrr_sup is kept reproducible behind `uv run data.py --include-sup` (off by default).

  PER ROW: input = de-bracketed natural-language story; output = json.dumps(gold_graph) = nodes [{entity_id, surface, gender, mention_spans=[[start,end) into input]}] + typed ATOMIC edges (the directly-stated proof-chain facts: {source,target,kinship_relation gendered surface, relation_type abstract, is_query=false, hop_count=1}; directed: t is source's relation) + noise_edges (extra story_edges CLUTRR does NOT type; structural only) + the held-out query_edge ({source,target,kinship_relation=gold,relation_type,target_int,is_query=true,hop_count}; deduced by composing >=2 atomics) + absent_relation_pairs (entity pairs in DIFFERENT connected components ⇒ provably no kinship path ⇒ 'no-relation'; structural/conservative, capped 20/story). Flat metadata_* per row: fold (train/dev/test), corpus, hop_count, noise_type {none,supporting,irrelevant,disconnected}, task_name, f_comb, query, atomic_facts, gold_proof (backward-chaining decomposition = trace-graph gold), genders, num_entities/num_atomic_edges/num_noise_edges/num_components/absent_pair_count, story_char_len. Top-level metadata emits ONCE the finite kinship COMPOSITION TABLE read verbatim from facebookresearch/clutrr (rules_store.yaml/relations_store.yaml): 11 relation TYPES (+inverse/symmetry flags), (type×gender)→surface map and reverse, composition rules rules[t1][t2]=t3, int↔text label_map 0..20, and a derived gendered surface composition table — explicitly NOT a full relation algebra.

  RECONSTRUCTION (verified on all 26,676 source rows, 0 violations): node_id→name = genders order (verified consistent with proof leaves on every row); atomic edges = story_edges[:len(edge_types)] (the proof chain is always the prefix); noise edges = story_edges[len(edge_types):] (left untyped, NOT fabricated — a word-before-bracket heuristic recovers only ~54% even on known edges). VERIFIED noise_type↔task mapping (config↔task correspondence): {1 none, 2 supporting, 3 irrelevant, 4 disconnected}; label_map matches the canonical 0..20 order; build flags={} (0 span mismatches, 0 missing genders, 0 hop disagreements, 0 proof-leaf inconsistencies).

  DESCRIPTIVE COUNTS ONLY (no composition/closure, no P/R/accuracy/N*/hallucination numbers, no LLM — those are iter-3): 26,676 stories, 124,819 entities, 78,472 typed atomic edges, 10,545 noise edges; folds train 20,144/dev 5,039/test 1,493; hops 2(10,235),3(10,514),4(5,101),5-10(826). HONEST CAVEAT: CLUTRR stories are short — min 39/median 201/MAX 871 chars; NONE reach the umbrella's ~3000-char target (n_ge_3000_chars=0) — reported, not hidden; longer documents must come from the temporal corpora.

  FILES: full corpus split into full_data_out/full_data_out_1.json + full_data_out_2.json (each <100 MB; merge examples of the same dataset name across parts to reconstruct), mini_data_out.json (3 examples/dataset, incl. multi-hop + absent-pair rows), preview_data_out.json (10 examples/dataset, strings truncated; spans hops 2..10 and absent pairs), results/dataset_metadata.json (QA/provenance/data card).

title: Real-LLM Matched-Coverage Closure Showdown on the Synthetic QCN Backbone
summary: |-
  Experiment experiment_iter2_dir3 (tag REAL-LLM-READ-ON-SYNTHETIC). A real OpenRouter LLM (google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite, temp 0) makes LOCAL disjunctive reads of the synthetic QCN NL realizations (gen_art_dataset_2); those reads feed the validated Mackworth PC-2 closure engine; and every baseline is compared at MATCHED single-relation coverage over the SAME networks. OUR METHOD Mode-A = iterated path-consistency closure that answers a deduction-required query (s,t) iff closure narrows it to a singleton (else abstains; empty-collapse = Mode-B inconsistency certificate). BASELINES: naive single-pass (iteration contrast), OFF (coverage 0), raw LLM, chain-of-thought, self-consistency K=5 (vote margin), LINC multi-formalization, Path-of-Thoughts (per-path independent), ILP-commit (Eirew M=5, transitivity ILP via PuLP/CBC).

  HEADLINE RESULT (test fold, 90 networks/cell x 14 cells x 2 algebras = 2520 networks; bite-bearing pool n=900/algebra): H1 CONFIRMED on BOTH algebras (Holm-Bonferroni adjusted, Bonferroni CIs exclude 0). POINT (3-relation convex point algebra, PC-complete/EXACT): Mode-A selective accuracy 1.000 vs PoT 0.957 (gap +0.043, adj-CI [0.024,0.063]) and vs self-consistency 0.854 (gap +0.146, adj-CI [0.114,0.181]). ALLEN (13-relation interval algebra, NP-hard, lower-bound): Mode-A 0.984 vs PoT 0.308 (gap +0.676, adj-CI [0.624,0.728]) and vs SC 0.343 (gap +0.641, adj-CI [0.588,0.691]); Mode-A also dominates CoT/raw/LINC/ILP. CENTRAL FINDING: the closure advantage over neural per-path reasoning SCALES WITH RELATION-ALGEBRA RICHNESS (point gap +0.043 << allen gap +0.676) -- on a simple 3-relation algebra the LLM already composes correctly, but on the rich 13-relation algebra neural chaining collapses while symbolic closure stays robust.

  SECONDARY: H3 iteration -- on a clean GOLD-reads reference, full PC strictly beats naive single-pass on cyclomatic structures (coverage gain +0.30 point / +0.16 allen, where naive single-pass resolves nothing) and on hop>=3, and TIES exactly at length-2 (gap 0.0) -- confirming the pre-registered theorem; the gap survives with REAL reads. C2: Mode-A coverage IS the deduction-required bite (OFF=0). AUDIT: per-edge recall 1.000 point / 0.966 allen (both clear the 0.90/0.85 gates -> operating knob S4_sound frozen on the dev fold); zero-FP-conditional-on-soundness = 1.0 on BOTH (empirical confirmation of PC soundness); silent-wrong only from unsound reads (0.0 point / 0.021 allen); within-doc soundness rho ~ 0; J(E) vs r^E reported; read error-type distribution recorded.

  DELIVERABLES: method.py (full pipeline), engine.py + llm.py (reused from iter-1 gen_art_experiment_3, with a per-call temperature/tag patch on llm.py enabling self-consistency sampling), dataio.py (entity-normalized reads -> 2520 networks collapse to 35 unique cached read prompts, making reads ~free), stats.py (matched-coverage selective accuracy, paired bootstrap fixed-tau primary + rematch sensitivity, Holm-Bonferroni, Page/Jonckheere/Spearman, ICC), tests.py (Stage-0 closure unit tests, all pass). Output method_out.json is schema-valid (exp_gen_sol_out): per-network examples carry predict_modeA/naive/off/raw/cot/sc/linc/pot/ilp; all rich analysis (H1 leaderboards+Holm, H3 hop/cyclomatic tables, C2, audit, per-stratum, worked-example narrowing + Mode-B collapse trace, cross-algebra synthesis, verdict) lives in top-level metadata. 6 figures (H1 leaderboards + H3 hop/cyclomatic per algebra). Total OpenRouter spend across all runs ~$3 (this final run $2.21, 24938 billed calls + 7674 cache hits), well under the $9 hard cap via SHA-256 entity-normalized caching. For the paper: an honest, decisive REAL-LLM-ON-SYNTHETIC win for closure-certified composition, scoped by algebra richness, with a clean zero-FP soundness audit and the iteration theorem confirmed.

  Realism-Matched Synthetic Channel: H3 gap, H4 inverted-U, silent-wrong re-established
summary: |-
  Repairs the two iter-1 synthetic-channel breaches and re-establishes the closure module's three mechanism results under a reader channel CALIBRATED to the iter-1 real-text frontier pilot (experiment_3 metadata.frontier_table, arm TBDense_dense). Zero LLM spend; pure CPU; ~140 s at full scale; schema exp_gen_sol_out validated.

  THE FIX (verified): iter-1's recall and breadth were independent inputs, giving a dead knob (recall flat 0.958) and per-edge error-type TV=0.25. Here the channel is a SINGLE ordinal knob S1-S5 that SAMPLES the per-edge error-type category directly from the calibrated real distribution, so recall = 1 - P(unsound|knob) is an OUTPUT. The real recall ladder is reproduced exactly: real [.572,.599,.625,.783,.796] vs sim [.572,.602,.623,.783,.796] (max err 0.003), with the matching breadth ladder [1.0,1.05,1.96,4.72,5.49].

  REALISM (all pass, realism_matched=True): (i) per-edge error-type TV in the apples-to-apples PROJECTED point ladder {singleton,pair,universal,unsound} = max 0.0065 (the naive 5-cat 0.19 exposes the point-algebra representability gap -- POINT cannot encode ALLEN 'loose'); the ALLEN direct-match arm matches the full 5 categories with TV 0.007. (ii) cross-edge soundness rho is calibrated to the directly-measured within-doc ICC; realism term = max |J2_sim - J2_real| = 0.073 (the real J2/J3 are internally inconsistent with any single exchangeable copula -- J2>p^2 but J3<p^3 on some knobs, a small-sample artifact -> Fallback B, report J(E) vs r^E descriptively). (iii) topology: contributing-edge-count E = minimal-deduction-path hop, cyclo = independent alternative routes; NNLS-matched to the NarrativeTime_point gold graphs (reachable deduction queries); short-range (E<=6) TV_E 0.13 and TV_cyclo 0.14 pass; the full TV_E 0.24 is driven by the long-hop tail outside the synthetic generator's range and is reported descriptively (the frontier pilot itself evaluated E=2 triangles).

  MECHANISM RESULTS (full N=600/cell, B=2000): H3 PASS -- FULL-vs-NAIVE iteration gap per fixed recall slice: length-2 tie (CI includes 0) at every slice, gap grows with hop length and with cyclomatic number, Page trend p ~= 5e-4 (correctly computed, NOT the paper's mis-stated 1e-13). H3 recall-dependence is itself a predicted signal: maxL gap rises 0.21->0.90 as recall 0.57->1.0 (predicted ~0.63 at recall 0.9; got 0.647). H4 PASS -- redundancy gives a recall-dependent inverted-U in Mode-A resolution; interior peak at recall<=0.78, peak shifts outward with recall (3 bins) and under the recall-floor gate, beats both best-single-path and OFF, and J(E)>r^E under rho>0 (frac 1.0 at low recall, centroid shift +1.04). Silent-wrong-vs-recall is monotone-decreasing and stays <= the per-network read-soundness bound 1-J(E) (RIGOROUS, asserted) and the per-edge (1-recall) reference; the E=2 (K=1) stratum is the highest -- redundancy converts over-commitment into DETECTED collapse, not silent error. The zero-FP soundness THEOREM (all-sound contributing edges => gold in Mode-A output with probability 1.0; collapse never co-occurs with all-sound) is verified and reported SEPARATELY (TAG=THEOREM) from the empirical curve (TAG=EMPIRICAL/SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL). C3 reliability: contains-gold slope on J(E)=0.65 (<1, point-algebra absorption -> certificate over-delivers), offset disappears under J(E) (attribution = independence-approximation failure, not soundness failure).

  For downstream GEN_PAPER_TEXT: method_out.json metadata holds realism{...}, recall_ladder_real_vs_sim, H3.by_recall_slice (per-slice Page/Jonckheere/Spearman, length2_tie, maxL_positive, cyclo_trend, recall_dependence), H4 (curves, peaks+CI, net_positive_regions, peak_shift_recall/gate, JE_vs_independence), silent_wrong_vs_recall (with per-edge/per-network bounds and E2 stratum), zero_FP_theorem, C3_reliability, allen arm, and overall_verdict. datasets[] carry worked H3 and H4 reads (predict_full/naive/off, outcome, n_contrib_edges, all_sound) including one Mode-A narrowing and one Mode-B collapse example. Five figures in figures/. Use the page_p_note and projection_note when correcting the paper's earlier claims.

  LOCAL-reader closure vs PoT/self-consistency on NarrativeTime+TDDMan with Prolog traces
summary: |-
  THE HEADLINE EXPERIMENT (experiment_iter2_dir5) of the Closure-Certified Text-to-Logic Deduction Module. It implements and compares, in ONE pipeline on the FROZEN ACTUAL NarrativeTime (dense host) + TDDMan (non-circular long-distance anchor) gold temporal graphs, our method against four baselines, all reading the SAME span-LOCAL LLM elicitations and resolving to a single coarse temporal relation (the shared coverage object).

  METHOD = Mode-A: iterated path-consistency CLOSURE (engine.pc2_full, Mackworth PC-2) over span-LOCAL reads of the constituent path edges of a deduction-required query, with the query edge HELD OUT (left at universe) so the closure must RECOVER it. BASELINES: (1) naive single-pass intersection (iteration contrast; ties Mode-A on length-2 by theorem); (2) raw local LLM forced-single from the query edge's own local read; (3) Path-of-Thoughts (per-path LLM composition, modal vote, abstain on path disagreement -- isolates the cross-path intersection step Mode-A adds); (4) self-consistency (majority over k paraphrase samples). Closure runs in the convex POINT start-point algebra (PC-COMPLETE, exact); the five coarse labels {before,after,simultaneous,includes,is_included} are exactly the five convex point relations.

  WHAT IT PROVIDES downstream (all numbers in method_out.json, TAGGED REAL-LLM-READ / SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL / GOLD-ONLY-GATE / THEOREM):
  * H1 (gateway, Holm-Bonferroni): Mode-A selective accuracy at MATCHED coverage vs PoT and SC, with doc-clustered paired-bootstrap CIs (risk-coverage curves interpolated to a shared coverage grid). Reported gaps vs PoT/SC/raw/naive + AUC + len2-vs-ge3/cyclic strata (Mode-A predicted to TIE naive on len2, dominate on >=3-edge/cyclic).
  * H2 (gateway): end-to-end confident-wrong (hallucination) rate of Mode-A (which abstains on disjunction/collapse) vs the raw LLM (forced single) on deduction-required queries; reduction vs the pre-registered 0.05 floor with doc-clustered bootstrap CI; decomposed into silent-wrong-narrowing (<= 1-recall bound). On the smoke/synthetic evidence Mode-A drives confident-wrong toward ~0 while raw is wrong on a large fraction -- the quantified hallucination-reduction deliverable.
  * Per-edge RECALL vs the 0.90 point gate for BOTH readers (primary google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite; stronger google/gemini-3.5-flash on a bounded NT sample) -- the stronger-reader gate-crossing answer localizes whether the bottleneck is real-text LOCAL read soundness (negative localization) rather than the closure step.
  * applicability: Mode-A singleton-resolution-to-correct rate vs GO-GENERAL(0.10)/GO-MODULE(0.05).
  * GOLD-ONLY-GATE: MATRES yields ~0 multi-path deduction queries (near-empty envelope, gate validation PASS).
  * A $0 fully-powered SYNTHETIC matched-coverage backstop (recall 0.96, 600 networks/cell, point-algebra channel) confirming the mechanism when reads are sound: Mode-A beats raw (~+0.22-0.26), SC, and PoT, ties naive on length-2, and structurally dominates naive/PoT in long-hop families (they cannot reach Mode-A's coverage).
  * A human-auditable Prolog trace deliverable: runnable prog.pl programs (results/worked_modeA.pl narrows to the correct singleton; results/worked_collapse.pl certifies inconsistency -> Mode-B abstain), discharged python-checked (swipl unavailable; H1/H2 are engine-independent) and cross-checked against the engine's Mode-A result.
  * examples[] per query edge with predict_modeA/naive/raw/pot/sc + gold + strata; figures (risk-coverage, synthetic matched-coverage).

  Genuinely NEW code: data_adapter.py (reads gen_art_dataset_1/full_data_out.json, char-offset event marking offset_ok=1.000, deduction-required multi-path query sampling), the span-LOCAL reads, the matched-coverage risk-coverage harness with Holm-adjusted doc-clustered bootstrap, the Prolog discharge, and synth_channel.py's matched-coverage harness. REUSED verbatim from iter-1: engine.py (QCN/pc2_full/naive), llm.py (cached, cost-guarded OpenRouter client), tests.py (blocking closure battery), corpora.py (coarse maps). A GLOBAL budget cap is enforced across all three OpenRouter clients (total < $9 < $10). Verdict policy: CONFIRM (both gateways) / PARTIAL/SCOPE-BOUNDARY (one) / DISCONFIRM/SCOPE-BOUNDARY (neither -> negative-localization + synthetic-mechanism, retargeted to NeSy/findings).

title: Iter-2 Local-Reader / Prolog-Discharge / CLUTRR Implementation-Decision Dossier
summary: >-
  Executor-ready, web-verified resolution of the six NEW implementation decisions the iter-2 closure-certified text-to-logic
  experiments need (beyond the iter-1 dossier art_aQ2Rf8rwqteI). (1) LOCAL-READER PROTOCOL: minimal-span unit = the single
  sentence containing each event mention (default; +/-1 sentence as a sensitivity arm), grounded in TimeBank-Dense's own annotation
  window (same-sentence + immediately-following-sentence + DCT; 5 relations BEFORE/AFTER/INCLUDES/IS_INCLUDED/SIMULTANEOUS
  + VAGUE=underdetermined); 'no shared span' = mentions never co-occur within the window => DEDUCTION-REQUIRED, computable
  WITHOUT the LLM (T0-safe); disjunctive Pairwise read prompt adapted from Wei et al. arXiv:2407.19568 (Bulk/Iterative/Event-Ranking/Pairwise)
  + METRE arXiv:2408.07353 multi-label, enumerate base relations + explicit UNIVERSAL option, 'name every relation the text
  does NOT rule out'. (2) DISCHARGE: SWI-Prolog via pyswip v0.3.3 (class-method Prolog.assertz/query, Python>=3.9, needs apt
  swi-prolog>=8.4.2, ctypes shared-lib + SWI_HOME_DIR/LIBSWIPL_PATH) PRIMARY, robust subprocess fallback `swipl -s f.pl -g
  goal -t halt` (exit 0/1/2), clingo 5.8.0 ASP as secondary; QCN encoded as edge(E1,E2,RelSet) + algebra-seeded compose/3,converse/2;
  readback |R|==1 emit / |R|>1 ABSTAIN / |R|==0 unsound-flag; CONFIDENT-WRONG = nonabstained-single-relation-mismatch-rate
  on the deduction-required/absent subset, matched-coverage, paired-bootstrap CI, pre-registered MDE, aligned to Logic-LM/LINC
  executable-rate practice. (3) CLUTRR: HF CLUTRR/v1 (14 configs, target 0-20 mapping, fields incl proof_state/f_comb/story_edges/edge_types)
  BUT datasets>=4.0 dropped scripts => load via huggingface_hub snapshot_download of the per-task CSVs (git-LFS) or pin datasets<4.0
  + trust_remote_code; kinship composition table = rules_store.yaml primitive compositions + relations_store.yaml surface<->primitive<->gender
  map (no-relation is a native primitive); absent-relation pairs CONSTRUCTED from rob_train_disc disconnected components /
  cross-family pairs; atomic-gold = story_edges+edge_types. (4) STRONGER READER: weak anchor = iter-1 google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite
  ($0.25/$1.50); recommend deepseek/deepseek-v3.2 ($0.2288/$0.3432, cross-family, CHEAPER, gate test ~$1.3) as budget-optimal
  stronger reader, google/gemini-3-flash-preview ($0.50/$3.00 thinking) as the clear capability-jump option on a stratified
  subsample; total two-reader run < $10 with disk cache + prompt caching + hard cost-guard. (5) SEVEN local-regime baselines
  each re-specified to read ONLY local spans with a matched single-relation abstention signal (raw verbalized-confidence,
  CoT, self-consistency vote-margin, LINC formalization-agreement, PoT path-agreement [confirmed per-path INDEPENDENT, no
  cross-path intersection], ILP-commit Eirew M=5, naive single-pass intersection), all thresholded to the SAME coverage object.
  (6) Four recent temporal/logical-consistency citations pinned (arXiv:2510.15513, 2502.11425, 2412.16100, 2409.14065) + a
  crisp novelty statement (disjunction-preserving abstain-on-collapse OUTPUT CONTRACT + gold-free closure CERTIFICATE + redundancy-as-coding-rate,
  NOT the algebra). Includes a consolidated decision table, exact IDs/URLs, and a 12-item gotchas list.

title: 'CLUTRR kinship gold graphs: two hop-stratified slices with absent-relation pairs'
summary: |-
  The clean END-TO-END venue for the closure-certificate umbrella, beside the iter-1 temporal corpora (NarrativeTime/TDDMan/MATRES) and the synthetic-QCN backbone. Standardizes CLUTRR (Sinha et al., EMNLP 2019, arXiv:1908.06177) into the aii exp_sel_data_out schema, ONE ROW per story, so iter-3 can deliver — in ONE setting — all four numbers the umbrella names: (i) atomic-extraction precision/recall, (ii) multi-hop deduction accuracy vs chain length, (iii) a human-auditable trace-graph, and (iv) a hallucination-rate reduction on absent-relation queries.

  THE BEST 2 DATASETS (26,676 rows total; target_num_datasets=2): clutrr_gen (gen_train234_test2to10; 16,131 rows; clean; train hops 2-3-4, TEST hops 2..10 → the accuracy-vs-length curve + atomic P/R + trace-graph) and clutrr_disc (rob_train_disc_23_test_all_23; 10,545 rows; disconnected-noise → 10,244 two-component stories yielding 71,684 genuine within-document ABSENT pairs for the hallucination demo; its test split also mixes clean/supporting/irrelevant/disconnected noise, so distractor examples for P/R robustness are present without a 3rd slice). The plan's explicitly-optional 3rd slice clutrr_sup is kept reproducible behind `uv run data.py --include-sup` (off by default).

  PER ROW: input = de-bracketed natural-language story; output = json.dumps(gold_graph) = nodes [{entity_id, surface, gender, mention_spans=[[start,end) into input]}] + typed ATOMIC edges (the directly-stated proof-chain facts: {source,target,kinship_relation gendered surface, relation_type abstract, is_query=false, hop_count=1}; directed: t is source's relation) + noise_edges (extra story_edges CLUTRR does NOT type; structural only) + the held-out query_edge ({source,target,kinship_relation=gold,relation_type,target_int,is_query=true,hop_count}; deduced by composing >=2 atomics) + absent_relation_pairs (entity pairs in DIFFERENT connected components ⇒ provably no kinship path ⇒ 'no-relation'; structural/conservative, capped 20/story). Flat metadata_* per row: fold (train/dev/test), corpus, hop_count, noise_type {none,supporting,irrelevant,disconnected}, task_name, f_comb, query, atomic_facts, gold_proof (backward-chaining decomposition = trace-graph gold), genders, num_entities/num_atomic_edges/num_noise_edges/num_components/absent_pair_count, story_char_len. Top-level metadata emits ONCE the finite kinship COMPOSITION TABLE read verbatim from facebookresearch/clutrr (rules_store.yaml/relations_store.yaml): 11 relation TYPES (+inverse/symmetry flags), (type×gender)→surface map and reverse, composition rules rules[t1][t2]=t3, int↔text label_map 0..20, and a derived gendered surface composition table — explicitly NOT a full relation algebra.

  RECONSTRUCTION (verified on all 26,676 source rows, 0 violations): node_id→name = genders order (verified consistent with proof leaves on every row); atomic edges = story_edges[:len(edge_types)] (the proof chain is always the prefix); noise edges = story_edges[len(edge_types):] (left untyped, NOT fabricated — a word-before-bracket heuristic recovers only ~54% even on known edges). VERIFIED noise_type↔task mapping (config↔task correspondence): {1 none, 2 supporting, 3 irrelevant, 4 disconnected}; label_map matches the canonical 0..20 order; build flags={} (0 span mismatches, 0 missing genders, 0 hop disagreements, 0 proof-leaf inconsistencies).

  DESCRIPTIVE COUNTS ONLY (no composition/closure, no P/R/accuracy/N*/hallucination numbers, no LLM — those are iter-3): 26,676 stories, 124,819 entities, 78,472 typed atomic edges, 10,545 noise edges; folds train 20,144/dev 5,039/test 1,493; hops 2(10,235),3(10,514),4(5,101),5-10(826). HONEST CAVEAT: CLUTRR stories are short — min 39/median 201/MAX 871 chars; NONE reach the umbrella's ~3000-char target (n_ge_3000_chars=0) — reported, not hidden; longer documents must come from the temporal corpora.

  FILES: full corpus split into full_data_out/full_data_out_1.json + full_data_out_2.json (each <100 MB; merge examples of the same dataset name across parts to reconstruct), mini_data_out.json (3 examples/dataset, incl. multi-hop + absent-pair rows), preview_data_out.json (10 examples/dataset, strings truncated; spans hops 2..10 and absent pairs), results/dataset_metadata.json (QA/provenance/data card). Reproduce: `uv run data.py` (downloads CSVs from the kliang5 raw mirror HF CLUTRR/v1 points at + the FB yamls; deterministic, no randomness).

title: Real-LLM Matched-Coverage Closure Showdown on the Synthetic QCN Backbone
summary: |-
  Experiment experiment_iter2_dir3 (tag REAL-LLM-READ-ON-SYNTHETIC). A real OpenRouter LLM (google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite, temp 0) makes LOCAL disjunctive reads of the synthetic QCN NL realizations (gen_art_dataset_2); those reads feed the validated Mackworth PC-2 closure engine; and every baseline is compared at MATCHED single-relation coverage over the SAME networks. OUR METHOD Mode-A = iterated path-consistency closure that answers a deduction-required query (s,t) iff closure narrows it to a singleton (else abstains; empty-collapse = Mode-B inconsistency certificate). BASELINES: naive single-pass (iteration contrast), OFF (coverage 0), raw LLM, chain-of-thought, self-consistency K=5 (vote margin), LINC multi-formalization, Path-of-Thoughts (per-path independent), ILP-commit (Eirew M=5, transitivity ILP via PuLP/CBC).

  HEADLINE RESULT (test fold, 90 networks/cell x 14 cells x 2 algebras = 2520 networks; bite-bearing pool n=900/algebra): H1 CONFIRMED on BOTH algebras (Holm-Bonferroni adjusted, Bonferroni CIs exclude 0). POINT (3-relation convex point algebra, PC-complete/EXACT): Mode-A selective accuracy 1.000 vs PoT 0.957 (gap +0.043, adj-CI [0.024,0.063]) and vs self-consistency 0.854 (gap +0.146, adj-CI [0.114,0.181]). ALLEN (13-relation interval algebra, NP-hard, lower-bound): Mode-A 0.984 vs PoT 0.308 (gap +0.676, adj-CI [0.624,0.728]) and vs SC 0.343 (gap +0.641, adj-CI [0.588,0.691]); Mode-A also dominates CoT/raw/LINC/ILP. CENTRAL FINDING: the closure advantage over neural per-path reasoning SCALES WITH RELATION-ALGEBRA RICHNESS (point gap +0.043 << allen gap +0.676) -- on a simple 3-relation algebra the LLM already composes correctly, but on the rich 13-relation algebra neural chaining collapses while symbolic closure stays robust.

  SECONDARY: H3 iteration -- on a clean GOLD-reads reference, full PC strictly beats naive single-pass on cyclomatic structures (coverage gain +0.30 point / +0.16 allen, where naive single-pass resolves nothing) and on hop>=3, and TIES exactly at length-2 (gap 0.0) -- confirming the pre-registered theorem; the gap survives with REAL reads. C2: Mode-A coverage IS the deduction-required bite (OFF=0). AUDIT: per-edge recall 1.000 point / 0.966 allen (both clear the 0.90/0.85 gates -> operating knob S4_sound frozen on the dev fold); zero-FP-conditional-on-soundness = 1.0 on BOTH (empirical confirmation of PC soundness); silent-wrong only from unsound reads (0.0 point / 0.021 allen); within-doc soundness rho ~ 0; J(E) vs r^E reported; read error-type distribution recorded.

  DELIVERABLES: method.py (full pipeline), engine.py + llm.py (reused from iter-1 gen_art_experiment_3, with a per-call temperature/tag patch on llm.py enabling self-consistency sampling), dataio.py (entity-normalized reads -> 2520 networks collapse to 35 unique cached read prompts, making reads ~free), stats.py (matched-coverage selective accuracy, paired bootstrap fixed-tau primary + rematch sensitivity, Holm-Bonferroni, Page/Jonckheere/Spearman, ICC), tests.py (Stage-0 closure unit tests, all pass). Output method_out.json is schema-valid (exp_gen_sol_out): per-network examples carry predict_modeA/naive/off/raw/cot/sc/linc/pot/ilp; all rich analysis (H1 leaderboards+Holm, H3 hop/cyclomatic tables, C2, audit, per-stratum, worked-example narrowing + Mode-B collapse trace, cross-algebra synthesis, verdict) lives in top-level metadata. 6 figures (H1 leaderboards + H3 hop/cyclomatic per algebra). Total OpenRouter spend across all runs ~$3 (this final run $2.21, 24938 billed calls + 7674 cache hits), well under the $9 hard cap via SHA-256 entity-normalized caching. For the paper: an honest, decisive REAL-LLM-ON-SYNTHETIC win for closure-certified composition, scoped by algebra richness, with a clean zero-FP soundness audit and the iteration theorem confirmed.

  Realism-Matched Synthetic Channel: H3 gap, H4 inverted-U, silent-wrong re-established
summary: |-
  Repairs the two iter-1 synthetic-channel breaches and re-establishes the closure module's three mechanism results under a reader channel CALIBRATED to the iter-1 real-text frontier pilot (experiment_3 metadata.frontier_table, arm TBDense_dense). Zero LLM spend; pure CPU; ~140 s at full scale; schema exp_gen_sol_out validated.

  THE FIX (verified): iter-1's recall and breadth were independent inputs, giving a dead knob (recall flat 0.958) and per-edge error-type TV=0.25. Here the channel is a SINGLE ordinal knob S1-S5 that SAMPLES the per-edge error-type category directly from the calibrated real distribution, so recall = 1 - P(unsound|knob) is an OUTPUT. The real recall ladder is reproduced exactly: real [.572,.599,.625,.783,.796] vs sim [.572,.602,.623,.783,.796] (max err 0.003), with the matching breadth ladder [1.0,1.05,1.96,4.72,5.49].

  REALISM (all pass, realism_matched=True): (i) per-edge error-type TV in the apples-to-apples PROJECTED point ladder {singleton,pair,universal,unsound} = max 0.0065 (the naive 5-cat 0.19 exposes the point-algebra representability gap -- POINT cannot encode ALLEN 'loose'); the ALLEN direct-match arm matches the full 5 categories with TV 0.007. (ii) cross-edge soundness rho is calibrated to the directly-measured within-doc ICC; realism term = max |J2_sim - J2_real| = 0.073 (the real J2/J3 are internally inconsistent with any single exchangeable copula -- J2>p^2 but J3<p^3 on some knobs, a small-sample artifact -> Fallback B, report J(E) vs r^E descriptively). (iii) topology: contributing-edge-count E = minimal-deduction-path hop, cyclo = independent alternative routes; NNLS-matched to the NarrativeTime_point gold graphs (reachable deduction queries); short-range (E<=6) TV_E 0.13 and TV_cyclo 0.14 pass; the full TV_E 0.24 is driven by the long-hop tail outside the synthetic generator's range and is reported descriptively (the frontier pilot itself evaluated E=2 triangles).

  MECHANISM RESULTS (full N=600/cell, B=2000): H3 PASS -- FULL-vs-NAIVE iteration gap per fixed recall slice: length-2 tie (CI includes 0) at every slice, gap grows with hop length and with cyclomatic number, Page trend p ~= 5e-4 (correctly computed, NOT the paper's mis-stated 1e-13). H3 recall-dependence is itself a predicted signal: maxL gap rises 0.21->0.90 as recall 0.57->1.0 (predicted ~0.63 at recall 0.9; got 0.647). H4 PASS -- redundancy gives a recall-dependent inverted-U in Mode-A resolution; interior peak at recall<=0.78, peak shifts outward with recall (3 bins) and under the recall-floor gate, beats both best-single-path and OFF, and J(E)>r^E under rho>0 (frac 1.0 at low recall, centroid shift +1.04). Silent-wrong-vs-recall is monotone-decreasing and stays <= the per-network read-soundness bound 1-J(E) (RIGOROUS, asserted) and the per-edge (1-recall) reference; the E=2 (K=1) stratum is the highest -- redundancy converts over-commitment into DETECTED collapse, not silent error. The zero-FP soundness THEOREM (all-sound contributing edges => gold in Mode-A output with probability 1.0; collapse never co-occurs with all-sound) is verified and reported SEPARATELY (TAG=THEOREM) from the empirical curve (TAG=EMPIRICAL/SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL). C3 reliability: contains-gold slope on J(E)=0.65 (<1, point-algebra absorption -> certificate over-delivers), offset disappears under J(E) (attribution = independence-approximation failure, not soundness failure).

  For downstream GEN_PAPER_TEXT: method_out.json metadata holds realism{...}, recall_ladder_real_vs_sim, H3.by_recall_slice (per-slice Page/Jonckheere/Spearman, length2_tie, maxL_positive, cyclo_trend, recall_dependence), H4 (curves, peaks+CI, net_positive_regions, peak_shift_recall/gate, JE_vs_independence), silent_wrong_vs_recall (with per-edge/per-network bounds and E2 stratum), zero_FP_theorem, C3_reliability, allen arm, and overall_verdict. datasets[] carry worked H3 and H4 reads (predict_full/naive/off, outcome, n_contrib_edges, all_sound) including one Mode-A narrowing and one Mode-B collapse example. Five figures in figures/. Use the page_p_note and projection_note when correcting the paper's earlier claims.

title: >-
  LOCAL-reader closure vs PoT/self-consistency on NarrativeTime+TDDMan with Prolog traces
summary: |-
  THE HEADLINE EXPERIMENT (experiment_iter2_dir5) of the Closure-Certified Text-to-Logic Deduction Module. It implements and compares, in ONE pipeline on the FROZEN ACTUAL NarrativeTime (dense host) + TDDMan (non-circular long-distance anchor) gold temporal graphs, our method against four baselines, all reading the SAME span-LOCAL LLM elicitations and resolving to a single coarse temporal relation (the shared coverage object).

  METHOD = Mode-A: iterated path-consistency CLOSURE (engine.pc2_full, Mackworth PC-2) over span-LOCAL reads of the constituent path edges of a deduction-required query, with the query edge HELD OUT (left at universe) so the closure must RECOVER it. BASELINES: (1) naive single-pass intersection (iteration contrast; ties Mode-A on length-2 by theorem); (2) raw local LLM forced-single from the query edge's own local read; (3) Path-of-Thoughts (per-path LLM composition, modal vote, abstain on path disagreement -- isolates the cross-path intersection step Mode-A adds); (4) self-consistency (majority over k paraphrase samples). Closure runs in the convex POINT start-point algebra (PC-COMPLETE, exact); the five coarse labels {before,after,simultaneous,includes,is_included} are exactly the five convex point relations.

  WHAT IT PROVIDES downstream (all numbers in method_out.json, TAGGED REAL-LLM-READ / SYNTHETIC-CHANNEL / GOLD-ONLY-GATE / THEOREM):
  * H1 (gateway, Holm-Bonferroni): Mode-A selective accuracy at MATCHED coverage vs PoT and SC, with doc-clustered paired-bootstrap CIs (risk-coverage curves interpolated to a shared coverage grid). Reported gaps vs PoT/SC/raw/naive + AUC + len2-vs-ge3/cyclic strata (Mode-A predicted to TIE naive on len2, dominate on >=3-edge/cyclic).
  * H2 (gateway): end-to-end confident-wrong (hallucination) rate of Mode-A (which abstains on disjunction/collapse) vs the raw LLM (forced single) on deduction-required queries; reduction vs the pre-registered 0.05 floor with doc-clustered bootstrap CI; decomposed into silent-wrong-narrowing (<= 1-recall bound). On the smoke/synthetic evidence Mode-A drives confident-wrong toward ~0 while raw is wrong on a large fraction -- the quantified hallucination-reduction deliverable.
  * Per-edge RECALL vs the 0.90 point gate for BOTH readers (primary google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite; stronger google/gemini-3.5-flash on a bounded NT sample) -- the stronger-reader gate-crossing answer localizes whether the bottleneck is real-text LOCAL read soundness (negative localization) rather than the closure step.
  * applicability: Mode-A singleton-resolution-to-correct rate vs GO-GENERAL(0.10)/GO-MODULE(0.05).
  * GOLD-ONLY-GATE: MATRES yields ~0 multi-path deduction queries (near-empty envelope, gate validation PASS).
  * A $0 fully-powered SYNTHETIC matched-coverage backstop (recall 0.96, 600 networks/cell, point-algebra channel) confirming the mechanism when reads are sound: Mode-A beats raw (~+0.22-0.26), SC, and PoT, ties naive on length-2, and structurally dominates naive/PoT in long-hop families (they cannot reach Mode-A's coverage).
  * A human-auditable Prolog trace deliverable: runnable prog.pl programs (results/worked_modeA.pl narrows to the correct singleton; results/worked_collapse.pl certifies inconsistency -> Mode-B abstain), discharged python-checked (swipl unavailable; H1/H2 are engine-independent) and cross-checked against the engine's Mode-A result.
  * examples[] per query edge with predict_modeA/naive/raw/pot/sc + gold + strata; figures (risk-coverage, synthetic matched-coverage).

  Genuinely NEW code: data_adapter.py (reads gen_art_dataset_1/full_data_out.json, char-offset event marking offset_ok=1.000, deduction-required multi-path query sampling), the span-LOCAL reads, the matched-coverage risk-coverage harness with Holm-adjusted doc-clustered bootstrap, the Prolog discharge, and synth_channel.py's matched-coverage harness. REUSED verbatim from iter-1: engine.py (QCN/pc2_full/naive), llm.py (cached, cost-guarded OpenRouter client), tests.py (blocking closure battery), corpora.py (coarse maps). A GLOBAL budget cap is enforced across all three OpenRouter clients (total < $9 < $10). Verdict policy: CONFIRM (both gateways) / PARTIAL/SCOPE-BOUNDARY (one) / DISCONFIRM/SCOPE-BOUNDARY (neither -> negative-localization + synthetic-mechanism, retargeted to NeSy/findings).

- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

YOUR TURN (gen_paper_text): Revise the paper.

You are a researcher improving your paper after receiving a conference review.
Take the feedback seriously and make substantive changes, not cosmetic ones.

1. ADDRESS REVIEWER FEEDBACK: For each critique in <reviewer_feedback>, either fix the
   issue in the paper or argue convincingly why it doesn't apply. Major critiques MUST
   be resolved -- they would cause rejection if left unaddressed.
2. USE THE NEW EVIDENCE: The artifacts in <new_artifacts_this_iteration> were created
   specifically to address the reviewer's concerns. Reference their findings to
   strengthen the sections that were flagged as weak.
3. REWRITE, DON'T PATCH: Don't just append new paragraphs. Restructure and rewrite
   the sections the reviewer identified as problematic.
4. MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY: Ensure the paper aligns with the updated hypothesis.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: latency (seconds, 0-5). Values: PostgreSQL=4.6s (red), Bao=2.8s (blue), RLQOpt=2.0s (green). Error bars +/-0.3-0.8. Sans-serif font, white background.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-06-17 17:15:46 UTC

```
### Goal

Develop an operational translation pipeline that converts unstructured textual content (e.g., short legal documents, news articles, kids' stories) into a formal first-order logic representation. The output must be capable of (probabilistic) reasoning using a logic reasoner (like Prolog), leveraging LLMs to dynamically resolve terminology, concepts, and relations that are not well defined in the explicit text.

### Reviewer Scope

Limit the technical core to areas the reviewer can deeply evaluate. Other fields are welcome for inspiration but should not host the substantive contribution.

Reviewer-evaluable areas: semantic technologies, logic programming, inductive logic programming, information retrieval, machine learning, LLMs, deep learning, knowledge extraction, knowledge graphs, reasoning, and text data analytics.

The pipeline should ingest a short document (approx. 3000 characters) and parse it into a structured, computable format. Methods may combine an LLM acting as a semantic translation engine (mapping natural text to first-order logic or Prolog predicates), a running logic interpreter (like SWI-Prolog) for symbolic execution, and the integration of upper ontologies like OpenCyc to supply necessary background structure and taxonomic grounding. Furthermore, an LLM should be deployed as a probabilistic reasoning engine to handle fuzzy unifications, semantic similarities, and logical gaps where strict symbolic matching fails due to language ambiguity.

Evaluation must be rigorous and compare the neuro-symbolic pipeline against purely neural baselines (e.g., standard RAG, chain-of-thought prompting) on standard logical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., RuleTaker, CLUTRR) or custom annotated datasets. It must specifically measure:
(i) the precision and recall of atomic fact extraction directly from the original document, and
(ii) the accuracy of multi-hop fact extraction and logical deductions that require synthesizing explicit document facts with implicit common-sense knowledge.

Outputs must provide human-auditable trace-graphs of the reasoning steps to clearly demonstrate the logical path taken.

Constraints: The pipeline must be highly reproducible on any short, professionally written documents. Inference must be executable on commodity hardware, and the system must report a quantified reduction in hallucination rates compared to raw LLM generation.

### Publication

Target ACL Knowledge Extraction track as the primary venue, with EMNLP or specialized neuro-symbolic AI conference tracks (e.g., NeSy) as fallback targets.

### Things to Avoid

Avoid simplistic propositional logic translations of the text. Avoid purely neural black-box systems that lack interpretable reasoning traces. The substantive contribution must be an operational, hybrid method for reasoning with textual content that explicitly minimizes hallucinations.
```

name: aii-paper-writing
description: Academic paper writing guidance for AI research. Covers paper structure, figure placeholders, bibliography building with Semantic Scholar, and citation rules. Does NOT cover LaTeX compilation or figure file generation — see aii-paper-to-latex for that.
---

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in one batch
3. Write the returned .bib text into `./references.bib`

Rules:
- Do NOT fabricate BibTeX entries — always fetch from Semantic Scholar
- If a paper isn't found (very recent preprint), write the entry manually as fallback
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."

name: aii-semscholar-bib
description: Build bibliographies using Semantic Scholar. Batch-fetch BibTeX for papers by DOI, ArXiv ID, or title. Use when writing papers, generating reference lists, or building .bib files.
---

## Tool: `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch`

Batch-fetch BibTeX entries from Semantic Scholar. Pass all references in a single call — the tool handles batching internally.

### How it works

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Post-process** → fix entry type, fix citation key (AuthorYYYY), inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": ""}],
  "failed": []
}
```

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in **one call**
3. Save `bib_text` from the response to your `references.bib` file
4. Check `failed` — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract title, authors, year, venue, DOI/ArXiv ID
3. If DOI/ArXiv found → retry `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with it
4. Last resort: write BibTeX by hand using **only verified info from the actual paper page**

### CLI (for manual use / debugging)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-semscholar-bib" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_semscholar_bib__fetch.py --refs '[
  {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
  {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
  {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
]'
```

`--json, -j` — output raw JSON instead of .bib text

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
