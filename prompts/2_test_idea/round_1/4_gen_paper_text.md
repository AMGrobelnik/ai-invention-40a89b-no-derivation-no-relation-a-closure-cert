<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A research paper writer (Step 3.4: GEN_PAPER_TEXT in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, all artifacts, the previous paper draft (if any), and reviewer feedback.
Write a complete paper draft with figure placeholders.

Publication-quality paper → strong contribution. Weak paper → wasted iteration.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<research_methodology>
Write like a researcher drafting a paper, not a chatbot summarizing bullet points.

- Structure as a paper would: research question → methodology → results → analysis → limitations. Not a list of "we did X, then Y."
- Ground every claim in specific artifacts and specific numbers. "Results show improvement" is empty — state effect sizes, baselines, and conditions.
- Be honest about what worked, what didn't, and why. Don't spin failures as "future work."
- The paper's headline contribution should be a positive or surprising finding. Negative results are valuable context but should not be the primary narrative — lead with what works.
- Address reviewer feedback from previous iterations explicitly — show you've thought about each critique.
</research_methodology>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

  Closure-Certified Composition for the Deduction Module of a Text-to-Logic Pipeline: Cross-Path Sound Narrowing Cuts Hallucinations
  on a DENSE Real-Text Temporal Graph, Iterated Closure Error-Corrects on Long-Hop Structures (Real AND Synthetic), and an
  Empirically-Audited Recall-Bounded Redundancy Optimum
hypothesis: |-
  LEAD -- THREE ARM-SCOPED CLAIMS, ONE GENUINE DISCONFIRMER EACH (read first; everything below only elaborates). (REAL-TEXT VALUE CLAIM) On the DEDUCTION-REQUIRED, multi-path subset of a DENSE direct-human-gold corpus, cross-path SOUND NARROWING (Mode A) BOTH (i) achieves strictly higher SELECTIVE ACCURACY AT MATCHED COVERAGE than Path-of-Thoughts AND self-consistency voting (coverage = single-relation resolution, the SAME object for every method), AND (ii) cuts the CONFIDENT-WRONG (hallucination) rate versus a raw LLM on the same absent-relation pairs -- both CI-separated under paired bootstrap; DISCONFIRMED if NEITHER the selective-accuracy gap nor the hallucination-rate drop exists on that subset. (ITERATION CLAIM) FULL ITERATED closure beats a NAIVE single-pass intersection with a gap that GROWS in hop-count and cyclomatic number -- demonstrated on synthetic long-hop/cyclic networks AND, where the dense corpus's a-priori-measured >=3-edge/cyclic stratum permits, ON REAL TEXT; DISCONFIRMED if full == naive even on multi-hop/cyclic queries (then the contribution is 'any intersection,' not ITERATION). (REDUNDANCY CLAIM) At fixed per-edge recall, net Mode-A gain is an INVERTED-U in path redundancy whose peak location increases with recall and shifts outward under a recall-floor gate; the ONE genuine disconfirmer is the ABSENCE of any redundancy region whose net gain beats BOTH best-single-path and naive-intersection baselines -- a flat/turned-over curve ALONE is NOT a disconfirmation, it is the predicted recall x redundancy interaction.

  THE TWO CRITICAL FIXES THIS ITERATION. (FIX 1 -- THE REAL-TEXT CORPUS NOW ACTUALLY HOSTS THE HEADLINE.) The prior version named MATRES the real-text primary, but MATRES annotates ONLY same-sentence and ADJACENT-sentence event pairs, so EVERY gold edge is locally co-occurring and hence DIRECTLY-READABLE; its deduction-required, multi-path-with-bite envelope is therefore structurally near-EMPTY (T0's N* ~ 0 by construction), not merely thin. We RESOLVE this by relocating the real-text headline to a DENSE, DIRECT-human-gold corpus and characterizing it a-priori with the SAME algebraic rigor previously lavished on MATRES: NARRATIVETIME / TimeBankNT (timeline-based annotation with FULL TLink coverage, a full re-annotation of TimeBank, IAA Krippendorff alpha ~0.68) is the DENSE CO-PRIMARY, whose start-point restriction lands in the CONVEX POINT ALGEBRA where path-consistency is provably COMPLETE (full-interval Allen scored as a lower-bound detector), and whose dense non-local gold is HUMAN-TIMELINE-PLACED -- a human holistic judgment, NOT algorithmic-closure output (unlike TimeBank-Dense, whose non-adjacent gold IS SputLink output). TDDMan (TDDiscourse: manually annotated LONG-DISTANCE, >1-sentence-apart pairs that 'cannot be inferred automatically from existing annotations') is the NON-CIRCULARITY-CLEAN corroboration arm: its gold is provably NOT the output of the algorithm we test, so a Mode-A win there MOOTS any residual timeline-implied-circularity worry about NarrativeTime. MATRES is RETAINED but REPOSITIONED as a GATE-VALIDATION CONTROL -- its N* ~ 0 demonstrates the deduction-required gate is DISCRIMINATIVE, not vacuous. (FIX 2 -- THE ITERATION WIN AND THE DOWNSTREAM METRIC ARE NO LONGER SYNTHETIC-ONLY / SECONDARY.) Because the dense corpus supplies real >=3-edge/cyclic constraint structures (prevalence computed in T0, zero LLM spend), the iteration-beats-naive claim is brought PARTLY ONTO REAL TEXT (length-2 real queries still tie naive, as predicted; >=3-edge/cyclic real queries can separate). And the END-TO-END HALLUCINATION-REDUCTION-ON-ABSENT-RELATION result -- the umbrella pipeline's actual deliverable -- is PROMOTED from a Tier-2 echo to a co-headline with its own pre-registered minimum effect size, so the real-text contribution is anchored to a downstream, venue-relevant metric, not only a held-out-edge selective-accuracy gap.

  T0 -- A-PRIORI ENVELOPE GATE, NOW COMPUTED FOR EVERY CANDIDATE CORPUS (zero LLM spend, runs FIRST, gates whether a real-text headline exists at all). From each gold graph ALONE we compute N* = the count of held-out edges that SIMULTANEOUSLY: (i) satisfy a structural deduction-required PROXY (their two events share NO local/adjacent-sentence span); (ii) are constrained by >=2 paths through distinct intermediate events; (iii) have non-universal gold compositions that retain BITE after any non-convex->VAGUE widening; (iv) whose cross-path intersection equals the gold singleton. We ALSO report the >=3-edge/cyclic structural prevalence (the real-text iteration envelope), the candidate count destroyed by widening, and a paired-bootstrap POWER calc per corpus. We do this for NarrativeTime, TDDMan, AND MATRES, and decide hosting via a PRE-REGISTERED applicability threshold stated as a NUMBER (see success criteria). The expected outcome -- MATRES N* ~ 0, NarrativeTime/TDDMan N* >> 0 -- is itself a reported result validating the gate.

  MODE A -- SOUND NARROWING (PRIMARY, zero-false-positive, over-commitment-ROBUST). The LLM emits, per text span, a high-recall 'sound-but-loose' DISJUNCTIVE set of base relations the span does NOT exclude (with an explicit underdetermined/universal option). When these sets are SOUND (gold inside each) but sub-universal, intersecting the compositions arriving at a query pair from MULTIPLE constraining paths yields a set that STILL contains gold yet is strictly tighter than any single path. We report TWO yields and name the load-bearing one: (i) STRICT-TIGHTENING yield (any reduction) and (ii) the HEADLINE-DRIVING SINGLETON-RESOLUTION-TO-CORRECT yield (intersection collapses the query to the single correct relation). Because the matched-coverage axis is single-relation resolution, only (ii) moves answered-point selective accuracy AND drives the hallucination-rate metric, so it is the headline number. Mode A requires only sub-universal edge BREADTH + MULTI-PATH BITE + SOUND inputs; it does NOT require over-commitment, is SAFEST at the high-recall elicitation end, is inert ONLY in the degenerate all-universal limit, and its zero-FP guarantee SURVIVES PC incompleteness because the intersection of sound sets is always sound.

  MODE B -- DETECTION/REPAIR (SECONDARY, Tier-2, zero-FP DETECTION conditional on measured recall). An empty closure collapse is a deductive certificate that some LLM edge is UNSOUND, with no gold labels; it requires at least one over-committed/recall-failed edge to fire and carries the pre-registered DUAL of SILENT WRONG NARROWING (an unsound set that OMITS gold drives closure to a confident WRONG singleton with NO collapse). Magnitude tracks the measured over-commitment rate; reported distinctly from Mode A.

  REDUNDANCY IS DOUBLE-EDGED -- AUDITED ON EMPIRICAL JOINT SOUNDNESS, NOT AN INDEPENDENCE PRODUCT. Mode A's zero-FP narrowing holds only when EVERY contributing edge is sound. We do NOT assume independent per-edge soundness (a single LLM reading one document produces positively-correlated reading errors). Instead of the product prod_e r_e we MEASURE the EMPIRICAL joint soundness J(E) = realized fraction of E-edge constraining subnetworks in which ALL edges are sound, directly from data, and report the within-document cross-edge reading-error correlation rho. The zero-FP audit's reliability curve is pre-registered against EMPIRICAL J(E); the inverted-U cost term is 1 - J(E); because positive rho makes J(E) decay SLOWER than r^E, the predicted peak sits FURTHER out than an independence model says. Net Mode-A gain RISES while marginal narrowing dominates, then FALLS once (1 - J(E)) silent-narrowing cost dominates -- an error-correcting code's OPTIMAL RATE with the decoding radius set by recall and the channel correlation MEASURED, not assumed.

  ITERATED-CLOSURE ISOLATION (so the win is not 'any intersection'). A NAIVE-INTERSECTION baseline intersects the compositions arriving at the query pair in a SINGLE pass, WITHOUT iterating to a fixpoint and WITHOUT algebra-seeded converse propagation. On length-2 multi-path queries naive-intersection and full closure COINCIDE (predicted and verified, including on the real-text length-2 stratum); on longer/cyclic networks iterated fixpoint propagation is the distinguishing ingredient, so the full-minus-naive gap GROWS with hop-count and cyclomatic structure -- localizing the contribution to ITERATED path consistency, now tested on BOTH synthetic networks and the dense corpus's real >=3-edge/cyclic stratum.

  NON-CIRCULARITY AUDIT (new, answers the timeline-implied concern). For NarrativeTime we partition held-out edges into LOCALLY-JUSTIFIABLE (a textual cue near both events that the local-only reader can exploit) versus PURELY-TIMELINE-IMPLIED (no local cue; gold obtainable only from the human's holistic timeline), and we foreground the latter as the deduction-required headline subset. Because that gold is HUMAN-timeline placement rather than algorithmic PC, recovering it by closure over INDEPENDENTLY LLM-read edges is non-circular (the human and the system use DIFFERENT inference processes). We additionally REPLICATE the narrowing win on TDDMan, whose gold is provably NOT auto-inferable, so the win cannot be a closure artifact on at least one corpus -- bounding the residual concern empirically rather than by assertion.

  HONESTY COMMITMENTS + READER-AGNOSTICITY (recall-AND-rho-matched). (1) zero-FP for Mode A = intersected set still contains gold whenever ALL contributing inputs are sound, audited against EMPIRICAL J(E); (2) zero-FP for Mode B is scoped to DETECTION only; (3) path consistency is SOUND-BUT-INCOMPLETE for full Allen IA / RCC-8 (consistency NP-complete; COMPLETE only for the convex point algebra and ORD-Horn), so the closure-detectable hallucination rate is a LOWER BOUND while the real-text PRIMARY point-algebra arm (NarrativeTime start-points) is exact; (4) silent wrong narrowing is pre-registered, bounded per-edge by (1-recall) and per-network by (1 - J(E)), tested with a recall-floor gate. The gain must be reader-AGNOSTIC: an ALTERNATIVE disjunctive edge-reader (a METRE-style multi-label head; a second LLM/prompt family) fed into the SAME closure pipeline preserves the cross-path-closure gain -- but because METRE is F1-trained (not recall-oriented) and may omit gold differently, each alternative reader's threshold is tuned to a MATCHED per-edge recall AND its measured rho is reported, and the agnosticity verdict is interpreted conditional on BOTH (if rho differs materially, we condition on rho rather than report a single delta) -- so 'the win is in the ALGEBRA' is not confounded by reader-specific error correlation.
motivation: >-
  Faithful multi-hop relational reasoning over short professional text -- temporal ordering of events in news, kinship in
  narratives, containment/region relations in descriptions -- is where LLM hallucination is most damaging and where a text-to-logic
  pipeline most needs to fuse explicit document facts with implicit composition knowledge while staying auditable. The umbrella
  pipeline reads text into FOL/Prolog predicates, types entities against an upper ontology, and answers queries with a reasoner;
  the WEAK LINK is the composition/deduction step. Existing systems handle composition unsatisfyingly: humans hand-craft composition
  rules (the kinship rules behind CLUTRR), which do not scale; the LLM composes freely, locally fluent but globally inconsistent,
  producing silent errors that solver-crash feedback (Logic-LM) and answer voting (LINC) cannot see; or paths are reasoned
  in ISOLATION (LAMBADA, Path-of-Thoughts), which deliberately avoids the global check and so cannot tighten a disjunctive
  query by intersecting evidence from multiple paths nor detect contradictions arriving at the same pair from two paths. A
  cluster of negative/commit-contract results sharpens the opportunity: Knez & Sun (2024, arXiv:2406.11486) show zero-shot
  LLMs assign MORE THAN ONE temporal relation to a pair for >=50% (up to 97%) of pairs and violate transitivity, then enforce
  consistency with ILP and find it DOES NOT improve F1; and -- decisively up to date -- a 2025 global zero-shot temporal-graph
  generator (arXiv:2502.11114, EMNLP 2025) STILL enforces uniqueness/symmetry/transitivity by ILP, committing to a single
  label per pair, preserving no disjunction, issuing no certificate, and offering no abstention. We read this lineage as evidence
  that consistency enforcement under the F1-maximizing COMMIT contract is the wrong objective; the LLM's native multi-relation
  output is not noise to be collapsed but a SOUND DISJUNCTION to be PRESERVED and NARROWED, and the right objective is faithfulness-by-abstention,
  not extraction F1. The qualitative-reasoning community has had exact, commodity-cheap path-consistency algorithms over relation
  algebras (Allen 1983; Renz & Nebel; GQR, SparQ) for forty years, but they assume a clean hand-given table and have never
  been coupled to an LLM reading relations off natural language. We are NOT the first to run closure over machine-extracted
  temporal relations (SputLink densifies TimeBank; CAEVO does global temporal inference via cascaded sieves; Ning et al.'s
  ILP enforces transitivity) -- but ALL COMMIT to a single consistent labeling to maximize F1, preserving no disjunction,
  certifying no reading error, offering no abstention. Our contribution is the OPPOSITE output contract: keep the LLM's job
  as high-recall disjunctive READING, use cross-path INTERSECTION as a zero-FP faithfulness operation (Mode A) and closure
  COLLAPSE as a gold-free reading-error certificate (Mode B), and optimize faithfulness via a risk-coverage objective. Three
  ideas make the transfer a genuine contribution rather than a port. FIRST, because Allen/point/RCC-8 tables are EXACT ground
  truth, cross-path intersection of SOUND sets can only move toward gold -- a calibration-free, zero-FP narrowing that needs
  no over-commitment and no labels, and multi-path redundancy becomes an ERROR-CORRECTING CODE over LLM extractions. SECOND,
  the coding-theory lens predicts an OPTIMAL RATE: narrowing stays zero-FP only while all contributing edges are sound and
  that JOINT probability (measured EMPIRICALLY as J(E), not assumed independent) decays with redundancy, so net benefit is
  an INVERTED-U whose peak we predict from measured recall and the measured cross-edge error correlation and shift with a
  recall-floor gate. THIRD, the objective inverts F1 -- we preserve disjunctive uncertainty and ABSTAIN, trading coverage
  for faithfulness, and we measure the ACTIONABLE yield (intersection-to-correct-singleton at matched coverage) and the DOWNSTREAM
  hallucination-rate reduction, not whether a set merely shrank. The decisive realism move this iteration is choosing the
  corpus that can ACTUALLY host the claim: MATRES annotates only same/adjacent-sentence pairs, so its deduction-required envelope
  is empty BY CONSTRUCTION; the headline must live on a DENSE, direct-human-gold corpus (NarrativeTime, full TLink coverage,
  human-timeline gold) and be corroborated where gold is provably non-closure-derived (TDDMan long-distance manual pairs).
  If it works, this is a general, training-free recipe for trustworthy relational deduction over text with quantified, certificate-backed
  hallucination reduction and replayable trace-graphs; if it fails (intersection rarely resolves correct singletons because
  real sets are near-universal; the redundancy peak sits at trivially low redundancy; recall failures dominate the joint-soundness
  bound; or even the dense corpus's deduction-required multi-path-with-bite slice is below the pre-registered applicability
  number), each is itself a publishable scope boundary on repairing LLM-read relational knowledge.
assumptions:
- >-
  ARM-SCOPED CLAIMS + DENSE-CORPUS RELOCATION (resolves the prior contradiction AND the MATRES-locality problem). The real-text
  narrowing/hallucination win is claimed on a DENSE direct-human-gold corpus's deduction-required multi-path subset (NarrativeTime
  CO-PRIMARY; TDDMan non-circularity corroboration), NOT on MATRES, which is EXPECTED TO FAIL the deduction-required gate
  by construction (same/adjacent-sentence annotation -> all gold local). Mode A beats path-isolated Path-of-Thoughts and answer-voting;
  it TIES naive single-pass intersection on length-2 queries; FULL ITERATED closure beats naive ONLY where >=3-edge/cyclic
  structure exists -- now demonstrated on synthetic AND, where T0 finds a usable real-text stratum, on real text.
- >-
  CORPUS ALGEBRA & NON-CIRCULARITY CHARACTERIZED A-PRIORI FOR ALL CORPORA (before any LLM spend). NarrativeTime gold = HUMAN
  TIMELINE placement (manual, full TLink coverage, IAA alpha ~0.68), restrictable to START-POINTS -> CONVEX POINT ALGEBRA
  where PC is COMPLETE and the table exact (full-interval Allen scored as a lower-bound detector); its non-local gold is human-holistic,
  NOT algorithmic-closure output, so closure recovery over independently-read edges is non-circular -- quantified by the LOCALLY-JUSTIFIABLE
  vs PURELY-TIMELINE-IMPLIED fraction. TDDMan gold = direct human annotation of long-distance pairs explicitly NOT auto-inferable
  -> a structurally non-circular anchor whose win moots the timeline-circularity worry. Mode A's zero-FP soundness SURVIVES
  PC incompleteness (intersection of sound sets is always sound), so the mechanism is not lost where completeness fails.
- >-
  REDUNDANCY IS DOUBLE-EDGED, AUDITED ON EMPIRICAL JOINT SOUNDNESS (no independence assumption). Mode A's zero-FP narrowing
  holds only when ALL contributing edges are sound. We MEASURE the empirical joint soundness J(E) and report the within-document
  cross-edge reading-error correlation rho. Net Mode-A gain is an INVERTED-U in redundancy at fixed recall, cost term 1 -
  J(E), peak located using empirical J(E); positive rho pushes the peak outward. A flat/non-monotone curve is the predicted
  recall x redundancy interaction, not a disconfirmation.
- >-
  A-PRIORI ENVELOPE GATE EXTENDED TO ALL CORPORA + CONCRETE APPLICABILITY THRESHOLD. From each gold graph alone (zero LLM
  spend) we count N* (deduction-required AND >=2-path AND bite-after-widening AND singleton-resolving) AND the >=3-edge/cyclic
  prevalence (the real-text iteration envelope), with a paired-bootstrap power calc, for NarrativeTime, TDDMan AND MATRES;
  we report widening-induced bite loss; and we pre-register the applicability-envelope threshold as a NUMBER (deduction-required
  multi-path-with-bite fraction >=10% of evaluable held-out edges = 'general mechanism'; 5-10% = 'useful module'; <5% = 'niche
  safety-net'). The headline is never contingent on an unmeasured quantity.
- >-
  ACTIONABLE YIELD = SINGLETON-RESOLUTION-TO-CORRECT + DOWNSTREAM HALLUCINATION REDUCTION, AND RECALL-AND-RHO-MATCHED READER-AGNOSTICITY.
  The matched-coverage win and the hallucination-rate drop are both driven by intersection-to-correct-SINGLETON (strict-tightening
  reported separately, stated non-load-bearing); the coverage axis (single-relation resolution) is applied IDENTICALLY to
  closure and every baseline. The gain is attributable to the ALGEBRA: swapping the disjunctive edge-reader preserves the
  gain when each alternative reader is tuned to MATCHED per-edge recall AND its rho is reported (conditioned on rho if it
  differs materially), so reader-specific error correlation cannot confound the conclusion.
investigation_approach: |-
  TIERING (pre-committed; T0 then Tier-1 must COMPLETE before Tier-2; a fully-executed T0+Tier-1 with a thin Tier-2 is the acceptable minimum publishable unit). T0 -- A-PRIORI ENVELOPE GATE FOR ALL CORPORA (zero LLM spend): from each gold graph compute N* (deduction-required AND >=2-path AND bite-after-widening AND singleton-resolving), the >=3-edge/cyclic prevalence, the widening-induced bite loss, and a paired-bootstrap power calc, for NarrativeTime, TDDMan AND MATRES; for NarrativeTime also compute the locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied split (non-circularity audit, structural proxy only). Decide hosting via the pre-registered applicability NUMBER; the expected MATRES N* ~ 0 vs NarrativeTime/TDDMan N* >> 0 is reported as gate validation. TIER-1 (headline-critical, on the dense co-primary): (T1) the RECALL-BITE FRONTIER map + pre-registered go/no-go; (T2) the real-text Mode-A comparison vs Path-of-Thoughts and self-consistency at MATCHED COVERAGE with paired-bootstrap CIs, stratified by deduction-required vs directly-readable; (T2b) the END-TO-END HALLUCINATION-REDUCTION on the deduction-required/absent-relation subset vs a raw LLM, with a PRE-REGISTERED minimum effect size; (T3) the SYNTHETIC long-hop/cyclic redundancy-scaling DECOMPOSITION separating Mode-A BENEFIT from silent-narrowing COST, locating the inverted-U peak, conditioning the zero-FP audit on EMPIRICAL J(E), PLUS a coarse REAL-TEXT decomposition anchor binned by contributing-edge count; (T4) the isolating ablations -- closure ON/OFF table-held-fixed, Mode-A-only, and NAIVE-INTERSECTION vs FULL ITERATED closure with hop/cyclomatic stratification ON BOTH synthetic AND the dense corpus's real >=3-edge/cyclic stratum (the iteration claim). TIER-2 (runs only after Tier-1): TDDMan non-circularity replication, RCC-8 second algebra, CLUTRR elicited-table ablation + absent-relation end-to-end demo, TimeBank-Dense (framed noisy-read-vs-clean-read), Mode-B repair quality, the METRE-style alternative-reader ablation, exploratory semiring variant.

  MULTIPLICITY POLICY (pre-registered; inoculates against a garden-of-forking-paths objection). CONFIRMATORY FAMILY (Holm-Bonferroni / hierarchical gatekeeping across the family; report ADJUSTED CIs): (H1) real-text Mode-A selective-accuracy gap vs PoT & voting; (H2) end-to-end hallucination-rate reduction vs raw LLM; (H3) full-minus-naive iteration gap growing with hop/cyclomatic; (H4) the single redundancy inverted-U disconfirmer. H1 and H2 are the gateway tests; H3/H4 are tested only if a gateway clears. EVERYTHING ELSE -- per-stratum splits, per-bin curves, reader-agnosticity, Mode-B repair, RCC-8/CLUTRR/TB-Dense, the real-text iteration stratum (corroborative) -- is EXPLORATORY, reported with nominal CIs and labelled as such.

  EMPIRICAL-J(E) ATTRIBUTION RULE (stated ONCE here): a reliability-slope offset that DISAPPEARS when the predictor is switched from the independence product r^E to empirical J(E) is the independence approximation failing (NOT a disconfirmation); an offset that PERSISTS under empirical J(E) is a genuine soundness failure. ESCALATION LADDER (stated ONCE here): the dense direct-human-gold CO-PRIMARY is NarrativeTime if its T0 N* clears the applicability number; TDDMan corroborates and supplies a non-circularity-clean (and harder) arm; MATRES is the gate-validation control; if NO real corpus clears the number even after these, the synthetic arm becomes the headline and real text is demoted to an honestly-scoped niche-safety-net boundary -- but T0 makes that decision before LLM spend.

  COMPACT LOGICAL STRUCTURE (claim -> precondition -> metric -> baseline -> CI test). [H1 REAL-TEXT NARROWING] Mode-A singleton-resolution-to-correct > PoT & self-consistency (ties naive-intersection) -> precondition: dense-corpus deduction-required multi-path-with-bite subset with N* powering the CI (from T0) -> metric: selective accuracy at matched coverage -> baselines: PoT (path-agreement abstain), self-consistency (vote margin) -> paired-bootstrap adjusted CI on the gap, separated from 0. [H2 HALLUCINATION REDUCTION] closure pipeline confident-wrong rate < raw-LLM on the absent-relation subset -> precondition: same subset -> metric: confident-wrong (non-abstained gold-mismatch) rate -> baseline: raw LLM forced to a single relation -> paired-bootstrap adjusted CI meeting the pre-registered minimum effect. [H3 ITERATION] full closure > naive-intersection, gap grows with hop/cyclomatic -> precondition: paths longer than 2 / cycles present (synthetic; real >=3-edge/cyclic stratum) -> metric: selective-accuracy gap vs hop-count bin -> baseline: naive single-pass intersection -> per-bin adjusted CI + monotone-trend test. [H4 REDUNDANCY OPTIMUM] net gain inverted-U with located peak; peak increases with recall; gate shifts it -> precondition: >=4 fixed per-edge-recall arms + estimation-precision pre-reg -> metric: separate benefit and cost curves vs redundancy (synthetic + coarse real anchor) -> peak-detection meeting the >=1-bin shift bar. [C2 PATH-CONSISTENCY] closure ON > OFF, table held FIXED -> paired bootstrap (exploratory). [C3 ZERO-FP AUDIT] realized fraction-still-contains-gold tracks EMPIRICAL J(E), slope ~1 (exploratory). [C5 READER-AGNOSTIC] gain persists under swapped reader at matched recall AND reported rho (exploratory). [C6 MODE-B] zero-FP DETECTION; repair toward gold (exploratory).

  PILOT AS A FRONTIER MAP (after T0, before main runs). On synthetic and real edges, SWEEP a prompt-elicited breadth knob across >=5 settings from 'name THE relation' to 'name the maximal SOUND set the text does not exclude.' At each setting MEASURE: per-edge RECALL = P(gold in emitted set); breadth distribution; over-commitment vs under-specification rate; raw closure-collapse rate; strict-tightening AND singleton-resolution-to-correct yields; local-only-reader accuracy defining the deduction-required fraction; and the within-document cross-edge reading-error correlation rho. PLOT the RECALL-BITE FRONTIER as a primary deliverable and pre-register go/no-go (a region clearing a recall gate AND non-trivial singleton-resolution-to-correct) BEFORE any main run. PRE-REGISTER the EXTENDED REALISM-MATCHING STATISTIC for the synthetic NL-realization: total-variation distance between real and synthetic per-edge error-type distributions PLUS a cross-edge error-CORRELATION (rho) match term PLUS a redundancy/path-topology match (contributing-edge-count and cycle-structure histograms), thresholds FIXED before generating the redundancy curve.

  PIPELINE (four stages). (1) NEURAL READING -- prompt the LLM (via OpenRouter, cheap model, short docs, caching; well under $10) to map each surface relation phrase onto a SOUND DISJUNCTION of canonical base relations at the pre-registered frontier operating point; for the NarrativeTime point-algebra arm restrict emitted vocabulary to CONVEX point relations on start-points (widen non-convex {<,>} to VAGUE) so PC stays COMPLETE, and MEASURE the bite lost. (2) ALGEBRA -- use the EXACT published composition table (Allen 13-relation, point algebra, RCC-8; the convex table for the coarse interval label sets); seed converses/identity from the algebra, never from an LLM. (3) SYMBOLIC CLOSURE -- build a QCN (nodes=events/entities, edges=relation SETS; query/held-out edge starts universal), run path-consistency to a FIXPOINT. Three instrumented variants: FULL iterated PC; NAIVE single-pass intersection at the query node (no fixpoint, no converse seeding); closure-OFF (table fixed). MODE A narrows by cross-path intersection and emits an answer ONLY when the query resolves to a single relation (coverage axis), else ABSTAINS. MODE B (Tier-2): an empty collapse CERTIFIES a reading error; compute a minimal Reiter-style hitting-set/MaxSAT repair preferring lowest-confidence edges, recording the diagnosis and flagging possible mislocalization. (4) AUDIT -- emit the QCN, which compositions fired on which paths, and repairs as a TRACE-GRAPH, optionally discharged in SWI-Prolog/ASP from the closed table for a replayable proof (connective tissue to the umbrella pipeline's auditability + quantified-hallucination-reduction requirements).

  DATASETS. DENSE REAL-TEXT CO-PRIMARY: NarrativeTime / TimeBankNT (Rogers et al., LREC-COLING 2024; arXiv:1908.11443) -- timeline-based FULL-coverage human re-annotation of TimeBank-Dense (news), IAA alpha ~0.68; start-point restriction -> convex point algebra (PC COMPLETE), full-interval arm as lower-bound detector; non-local gold is HUMAN-timeline-placed (non-circular vs algorithmic PC). NON-CIRCULARITY ANCHOR: TDDMan (Naik et al., TDDiscourse 2019; aclanthology W19-5929) -- MANUAL long-distance (>1-sentence-apart) pairs that 'cannot be inferred automatically from existing annotations'; relation set {before, after, simultaneous, includes, is_included}, mutually exclusive (no VAGUE), coarse interval algebra; cleanest non-circularity, used to replicate the narrowing win where gold is provably not a closure artifact. GATE-VALIDATION CONTROL: MATRES (Ning, Wu & Roth 2018) -- same/adjacent-sentence annotation, expected N* ~ 0 on the deduction-required gate, demonstrating the gate discriminates. SYNTHETIC PRIMARY (clean ground truth, controlled redundancy): a Renz-Nebel-style random consistent Allen/point QCN generator GUARANTEEING redundant paths/cycles and sweeping redundancy/density/hop-count INDEPENDENTLY; the NL-realization protocol is VALIDATED to clear the EXTENDED realism statistic; the redundancy DECOMPOSITION is reported at >=4 FIXED per-edge-recall levels with >=500 networks per cell. SECOND ALGEBRA: RCC-8 synthetic. ELICITED-TABLE VENUE: CLUTRR kinship (LLM-elicited table vs gold) doubling as an end-to-end hallucination-reduction-on-ABSENT-relation demo. TimeBank-Dense as a Tier-2 noisy-read-vs-clean-read arm; RuleTaker an out-of-scope propositional contrast.

  KEY ABLATIONS: (i) closure/intersection ON vs OFF with the table HELD FIXED; (ii) NAIVE single-pass vs FULL iterated closure with hop/cyclomatic stratification (synthetic + real); (iii) Mode A ONLY vs Mode A+B; (iv) disjunction OFF (force singletons); (v) exact-table vs LLM-elicited-table (kinship); (vi) recall-floor gate ON vs OFF; (vii) ALTERNATIVE EDGE-READER (METRE-style multi-label head + a second LLM into the SAME closure pipeline -- recall-AND-rho-matched). BASELINES, EACH WITH A MATCHED ABSTENTION SIGNAL thresholded to the SAME coverage object: raw LLM (verbalized confidence), CoT, self-consistency (vote margin), LINC-style multi-formalization vote, DSR-LM-style induced-rule Prolog (no closure), Path-of-Thoughts (PRIMARY real-text baseline; path-agreement abstain), NAIVE single-pass intersection (iteration contrast), a TempRel-style COMMIT baseline, and a soft-unification neural theorem prover.

  METRICS, per-regime and STRATIFIED: (1) SINGLETON-RESOLUTION-TO-CORRECT yield + risk-coverage/selective accuracy AT MATCHED COVERAGE (HEADLINE H1) with paired-bootstrap adjusted CIs, reported alongside strict-tightening yield (stated non-load-bearing); (2) END-TO-END hallucination-rate reduction vs raw LLM on the deduction-required/absent-relation subset (HEADLINE H2) with a pre-registered minimum effect; (3) empirical zero-FP audit CONDITIONED on EMPIRICAL J(E) (reliability curve slope ~1; rho reported); (4) REDUNDANCY DECOMPOSITION (benefit vs silent-narrowing cost, located peak, gate shift) on SYNTHETIC + coarse REAL anchor; (5) full-minus-naive gap vs hop/cyclomatic on SYNTHETIC and the real >=3-edge/cyclic stratum; (6) Mode-B detection (lower bound on Allen IA/RCC-8, exact on the point-algebra arm) + repair quality; (7) reader-agnostic closure delta at matched recall and reported rho; (8) APPLICABILITY ENVELOPE -- relation-composable, multi-path-with-bite, deduction-required, AND >=3-edge/cyclic fractions per corpus (N* up front), scored against the pre-registered NUMBER; (9) atomic extraction P/R as a HELD-FIXED control; (10) the non-circularity audit (locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied fraction on NarrativeTime). Closure and repair run in milliseconds per network on a laptop.
success_criteria: |-
  THREE ARM-SCOPED HEADLINE PREDICTIONS (stated before all qualifiers; the confirmatory family H1-H4 is Holm-Bonferroni-adjusted, H1/H2 are gateways). CONFIRM lines: (REAL-TEXT) On the dense co-primary's deduction-required multi-path-with-bite subset at the pre-registered frontier operating point, Mode A achieves strictly higher SELECTIVE ACCURACY AT MATCHED COVERAGE than Path-of-Thoughts AND self-consistency (H1), AND cuts the CONFIDENT-WRONG (hallucination) rate versus a raw LLM on the same absent-relation pairs by at least the pre-registered minimum effect (H2) -- both adjusted-CI-separated from zero, driven by singleton-resolution-to-correct; Mode A is PREDICTED TO TIE naive single-pass intersection on the length-2 stratum and that tie is reported as confirmation, not failure. (ITERATION) FULL ITERATED closure beats NAIVE single-pass intersection with the gap GROWING in hop-count/cyclomatic number (and ~0 on length-2) on synthetic QCNs AND, where T0 found a usable real >=3-edge/cyclic stratum, on real text (H3). (REDUNDANCY) Net Mode-A gain is an INVERTED-U whose peak increases with recall and shifts outward under the recall-floor gate, at the pre-registered estimation precision (>=4 recall levels, >=500 networks/cell, >=1-bin minimum-detectable peak shift, peak bin CI-above both neighbors) (H4). Additionally CONFIRMS if: T0 reports N* clearing the applicability NUMBER on >=1 real corpus (NarrativeTime preferred, TDDMan corroborating) so the headline is genuine deduction not re-reading; the empirical zero-FP audit tracks J(E) (slope ~1, rho reported, slope-offset correctly attributed); the coarse real-text redundancy anchor matches the synthetic inverted-U sign; disjunction-ON beats commit-to-singleton; and the gain is reader-agnostic at matched recall+rho. DISCONFIRM lines: (REAL-TEXT) NEITHER a singleton-resolution advantage over PoT/voting NOR a hallucination-rate drop vs raw LLM exists on the deduction-required multi-path-with-bite subset even when sound sets are sub-universal and bite exists; (ITERATION) the full-minus-naive gap is ~0 even on multi-hop/cyclic queries (the win is 'any intersection,' not iteration); (REDUNDANCY) the SINGLE genuine disconfirmer -- the ABSENCE of any net-positive redundancy region beating BOTH best-single-path and naive-intersection (a flat/turned-over curve ALONE is NOT a disconfirmation); or T0 shows NO corpus clears the applicability NUMBER (then honestly scoped to synthetic + niche-safety-net).

  PRE-REGISTERED FAILURE MODES (each a publishable scope boundary): [NEAR-UNIVERSAL UNDER-SPECIFICATION | precondition: sets effectively universal | bound: Mode A inert, intersection cannot resolve singletons | the ONLY under-specification outcome that disconfirms Mode A]. [SILENT WRONG NARROWING | precondition: a contributing set OMITS gold (unsound) | bound: rate <= (1-recall) per-edge and (1 - J(E)) per-network | suppressed by the recall-floor gate, which also shifts the redundancy peak]. [CONSISTENT-BUT-WRONG ELICITED TABLE | precondition: LLM supplies the composition table | bound: quantified vs gold in kinship only | shown NOT to arise in exact-table settings]. [INVISIBLE SINGLE-CHAIN HALLUCINATION | precondition: confident self-consistent single chain | bound: closure cannot see it | scopes Mode B to multi-path collapse only]. [TINY/CIRCULAR ENVELOPE | precondition: N* below the applicability NUMBER even on the dense corpus, or gold purely-timeline-implied with no non-circular replication on TDDMan | bound: contribution scoped to synthetic + niche safety-net | decided a-priori by T0, not after spend]. Throughout, 'zero false-positive' is stated separately for Mode A (intersected set still contains gold under JOINT-sound inputs, audited against EMPIRICAL J(E)) and Mode B (DETECTION only); the closure-detectable hallucination rate is a LOWER BOUND because PC is incomplete for Allen IA/RCC-8 (complete only on the NarrativeTime start-point convex-point-algebra arm). Atomic extraction P/R must remain comparable to baselines, the per-corpus fractions (including a-priori N* and the >=3-edge/cyclic prevalence) must be reported up front, and trace-graphs must be judged human-auditable.

  NarrativeTime / TimeBankNT (Rogers et al., LREC-COLING 2024; arXiv:1908.11443): the FIRST timeline-based annotation achieving
  FULL coverage of all possible TLinks, a human re-annotation of TimeBank-Dense (news) with IAA Krippendorff alpha ~0.68 and
  significantly higher density, plus tools converting to TimeML. We USE it as the dense real-text CO-PRIMARY because (unlike
  MATRES) it has direct human gold for NON-LOCAL pairs and (unlike TimeBank-Dense) its dense relations are HUMAN-timeline-backed
  rather than SputLink-inferred. Difference from our work: NarrativeTime is a DATASET/annotation scheme producing a single
  consistent labeling for extraction evaluation; it neither preserves LLM disjunction, intersects compositions across paths,
  certifies reading errors, nor abstains. We restrict its start-points to the convex point algebra (PC COMPLETE) and audit
  the locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied fraction to neutralise residual circularity.

  TDDiscourse / TDDMan (Naik, Breitfeller et al., 2019; aclanthology W19-5929): the first dataset of DISCOURSE-LEVEL temporal
  links between events MORE THAN ONE SENTENCE APART, MANUALLY annotating global pairs that 'cannot be inferred automatically
  from existing annotations,' doubling TimeBank-Dense's links; relation set {before, after, simultaneous, includes, is_included},
  mutually exclusive, no VAGUE. We USE TDDMan as the NON-CIRCULARITY anchor: its gold is provably NOT the output of the closure
  algorithm we test, so a Mode-A narrowing win there cannot be a closure artifact. Difference: TDDiscourse is a benchmark
  for committed single-label discourse-level extraction; it preserves no disjunction, performs no cross-path intersection,
  issues no certificate, and does not abstain.

  Global Zero-shot Temporal Graph Generation (2025, arXiv:2502.11114; EMNLP 2025 main): prompts an LLM to generate a whole
  temporal graph, aggregates M=5 generations, then enforces uniqueness/symmetry/transitivity with ILP using Allen's laws.
  MOST RECENT directly-relevant prior art. Difference: it COMMITS to a single deterministic label per pair, preserves NO disjunction,
  intersects NO compositions across paths, issues NO gold-free certificate, and does NOT abstain -- the same F1-maximizing
  COMMIT contract we invert.
- >-
  Knez & Sun 2024 (arXiv:2406.11486): zero-shot LLMs assign MORE THAN ONE relation to a pair for >=50% (up to 97%) of pairs
  and violate uniqueness/transitivity; the authors ENFORCE consistency with ILP and find it DOES NOT improve F1. Difference:
  it enforces consistency under the F1-maximizing COMMIT contract (which it shows fails); no closure-as-CERTIFICATE, no preserved
  disjunction, no abstention/risk-coverage, no cross-path zero-FP narrowing. We read its negative result as motivation to
  PRESERVE and NARROW the disjunction.

  Hu, Huang & Feng 2024 (arXiv:2408.07353, METRE): a TRAINED multi-LABEL classifier inferring the possibility of each temporal
  relation independently, treating VAGUE as >1 possible relation, on TB-Dense/MATRES/UDS-T. Difference: METRE is trained to
  maximise F1 (not recall-oriented soundness); it carries no set through an EXACT composition table across MULTIPLE paths,
  performs no cross-path intersection, issues no certificate, does not abstain. We use it as an ALTERNATIVE EDGE-READER into
  the SAME closure pipeline (Tier-2) at MATCHED per-edge recall with reported rho, to show the cross-path-closure gain is
  reader-AGNOSTIC -- explicitly handling that its F1 training may make its soundness differ from the LLM reader.

  Temporal-relation extraction with ILP global inference (Ning, Feng & Roth 2017, EMNLP; CogCompTime) and SputLink (Verhagen
  2004/2005) / CAEVO (Chambers et al. 2014, TACL): trained/sieve extractors that enforce transitivity to output a single globally-consistent
  labeling; SputLink computes closure to DENSIFY TimeBank. Differences: all COMMIT to one relation per pair for F1, use learned/approximate
  inference, and (for SputLink) produce the very non-adjacent gold whose circularity we AVOID by using NarrativeTime's direct
  human-timeline gold and TDDMan's manual non-auto-inferable gold; we PRESERVE disjunction, NARROW by exact-table cross-path
  intersection, and ABSTAIN.

  Path-of-Thoughts (2024, arXiv:2412.17963): graph extraction -> path identification -> per-path reasoning, beating SOTA by
  up to 21.3% on StepGame/CLUTRR. PRIMARY real-text baseline. Difference (verified): it calls an external reasoner 'for each
  reasoning path' INDEPENDENTLY and does NOT intersect relations arriving at the same pair from multiple paths nor detect
  cross-path contradictions; when paths disagree it outputs multiple relations but does NOT abstain. This is EXACTLY the gap
  Mode A fills; PoT is given a matched abstention signal (path-agreement).

  DSR-LM / 'LLMs can Learn Rules' (Yang et al. 2023, arXiv:2305.03742; Zhu et al. 2023, arXiv:2310.07064): INDUCE weighted/symbolic
  composition rules to fit task accuracy. Difference: rule induction optimises data fit and gives a point answer; we enforce
  the EXACT ALGEBRAIC LAWS (converse, associativity, disjointness) necessary for soundness independent of training data, and
  use closure for zero-FP narrowing, detection, repair, and abstention. Our table-held-fixed closure ON-vs-OFF ablation isolates
  path-consistency from 'a fixed consistent table exists' (DSR-LM's contribution).

  Logic-LM (Pan et al. 2023, arXiv:2305.12295) and LINC (Olausson et al. 2023, arXiv:2310.15164): Logic-LM self-refines using
  solver crash/unsat messages; LINC majority-votes the answers of multiple formalisations. Difference: Logic-LM reacts only
  to crashes and has no positive global INVARIANT over relational knowledge; LINC's answer-level voting cannot see that individually-popular
  composition steps are JOINTLY inconsistent, nor tighten a disjunctive query by intersection. Algebraic closure is a global
  necessary condition both lack; we give LINC vote-agreement as a matched abstention signal.
- >-
  LAMBADA (Kazemi et al. 2023, arXiv:2212.13894) and path-isolation reasoning: backward chaining / per-path reasoning that
  manages inconsistency by COMPOSITIONAL ISOLATION rather than global enforcement. Difference: we INTERSECT across paths via
  closure, which both tightens disjunctions (Mode A) and detects contradictions (Mode B); isolation can return mutually inconsistent
  answers and cannot resolve disjunctive uncertainty.

  Logically Consistent Language Models / LOCO-LMs (Calanzone, Teso & Vergari 2024, arXiv:2409.13724; ICLR 2025): a TRAINING-TIME
  neuro-symbolic loss fine-tuning an LLM to be consistent with propositional facts/rules. Difference: it is training-time
  and PROPOSITIONAL; we are training-free at INFERENCE time and enforce multi-hop COMPOSITION closure over a RELATION ALGEBRA
  read off text, producing per-instance certificates, abstention, and trace-graphs.

  Generic LLM selective prediction / abstention, incl. temporal QA (SelectLLM 2025; abstention surveys 2025; 'When Silence
  Is Golden: Can LLMs Learn to Abstain in Temporal QA' arXiv:2602.04755): reduce error by abstaining via learned uncertainty,
  vote margins, or RL with abstention-aware rewards. Difference: abstention is driven by GENERIC confidence/uncertainty signals
  or learned at the QA-answer level; there is no algebraic consistency certificate, no per-edge reading-error localisation,
  no preserved relation-algebra disjunction, and no closure-based narrowing. Ours abstains precisely because deductive closure
  leaves the query a disjunction -- a structural, training-free, per-edge certificate.

  Classical qualitative reasoners and tractability theory: GQR, SparQ, Allen (1983), Mackworth (1977, path-consistency PC-1/PC-2
  ITERATED to a fixpoint -- distinguishing full closure from a single intersection pass, exploited in our naive-intersection
  ablation), Renz & Nebel (random network model A(n,d,l)), Vilain & Kautz 1986 (point algebra), Nebel & Burckert 1995 (ORD-Horn,
  JACM 42(1)). So PC is COMPLETE for the convex point algebra and ORD-Horn yet SOUND-BUT-INCOMPLETE for full Allen IA / RCC-8.
  Difference: these assume a clean human-given table on already-formal data; none read the algebra off NL via an LLM, certify
  reading errors, narrow by cross-path intersection of LLM disjunctions, model an EMPIRICALLY-audited recall-bounded redundancy
  OPTIMUM, or optimise risk-coverage.
inspiration: >-
  A Level-3 (methodological) cross-domain transfer from Qualitative Spatial-Temporal Reasoning and Tarski's relation algebras
  -- Allen's interval algebra, RCC-8, the convex point algebra, composition tables, and the path-consistency / algebraic-closure
  constraint-propagation algorithms (GQR/SparQ; Mackworth's iterated PC), plus the tractability theory (point-algebra and
  ORD-Horn completeness vs full-Allen NP-completeness) -- imported into LLM-based relational reasoning and hallucination control,
  with Reiter's 1980s model-based diagnosis (minimal hitting sets of conflict sets) for localising which extracted atom to
  retract. The Level-1 framing is CODING THEORY: an exact composition table turns multi-path redundancy in a document into
  an error-correcting code over LLM extractions -- redundant constraining paths let closure DETECT and CORRECT mis-reads with
  no external labels, as parity checks detect bit errors. The coding-theory 'optimal rate' sharpening (net benefit is an INVERTED-U
  because narrowing stays zero-FP only while every contributing symbol is sound) is made RIGOROUS: the joint-soundness 'decoding
  margin' is MEASURED empirically as J(E) rather than assumed as the independence product r^E, since a single LLM reader produces
  positively-correlated reading errors -- so the predicted peak uses the measured channel correlation. The Level-2 framing
  is SELECTIVE PREDICTION / risk-coverage in ML: compare an abstaining method against non-abstaining baselines at MATCHED
  COVERAGE with a shared coverage object and report the ACTIONABLE (singleton-resolution-to-correct) yield AND the downstream
  hallucination-rate reduction. Two refinements drive THIS iteration. (a) CORPUS SELECTION AS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: a mechanism's
  claim must live on a corpus that can structurally host it -- since MATRES annotates only adjacent-sentence pairs its deduction-required
  envelope is empty by construction, so the headline is relocated to a DENSE, full-coverage, direct-human-gold corpus (NarrativeTime)
  and corroborated where gold is provably non-closure-derived (TDDMan), with MATRES retained as a control that proves the
  gate discriminates. (b) ARM SCOPING borrowed from the discipline of stating where a mechanism's advantage must and must
  not appear: iterated closure provably equals a single intersection pass on acyclic length-2 structures, so the iteration
  win is claimed only on >=3-edge/cyclic structures -- now found on BOTH synthetic networks and the dense corpus's real long-hop
  stratum, dissolving the prior internal contradiction without confining the win to synthetic data. Three cross-field insights
  anchor the design: (1) LLMs are competent LOCAL qualitative namers that do NOT propagate constraints across paths -- the
  missing piece is global ITERATED propagation, and cross-path INTERSECTION of sound sets is a zero-FP win needing no over-commitment;
  (2) because the table is mathematical ground truth, intersection-of-sound-sets can only move toward gold and collapse-of-unsound-sets
  is a calibration-free certificate -- flipping the objective from accuracy-by-committing (ILP global inference, whose own
  results show consistency-enforcement does not raise F1) to faithfulness-by-abstaining; (3) the coding-theory lens names
  BOTH the safe primary mode (erasure-style narrowing) and the Achilles heel (a recall-bounded decoding radius whose EMPIRICAL
  joint-soundness decay produces an inverted-U), elevated to a pre-registered, decomposed, estimation-precision-bounded prediction
  anchored on both synthetic and real text.
terms:
- term: Dense direct-human-gold CO-PRIMARY (NarrativeTime / TimeBankNT)
  definition: >-
    The relocated real-text headline host: a timeline-based, FULL-TLink-coverage human re-annotation of TimeBank-Dense (news),
    IAA Krippendorff alpha ~0.68. Its density supplies abundant multi-path and >=3-edge/cyclic constraint structures (hosting
    both narrowing and a real-text iteration demonstration); its start-point restriction lands in the convex point algebra
    (PC COMPLETE); and its non-local gold is HUMAN-timeline-placed, not algorithmic-closure output, so closure recovery is
    non-circular. Replaces MATRES as primary because MATRES annotates only adjacent-sentence pairs.
- term: Gate-validation control (MATRES)
  definition: >-
    MATRES is retained but repositioned: because it annotates ONLY same/adjacent-sentence event pairs, every gold edge is
    locally co-occurring (directly-readable), so its deduction-required multi-path-with-bite envelope is structurally near-EMPTY
    and T0's N* ~ 0 by construction. Reporting this N* ~ 0 alongside NarrativeTime/TDDMan N* >> 0 demonstrates the deduction-required
    gate is DISCRIMINATIVE rather than vacuous.
- term: Non-circularity anchor (TDDMan)
  definition: >-
    The manually-annotated long-distance (>1-sentence-apart) subset of TDDiscourse whose pairs 'cannot be inferred automatically
    from existing annotations' -- so its gold is provably NOT the output of the closure algorithm under test. A Mode-A narrowing
    win on TDDMan therefore cannot be a closure artifact, bounding the residual timeline-implied-circularity worry about NarrativeTime
    by empirical replication rather than assertion. Relation set {before, after, simultaneous, includes, is_included}, coarse
    interval algebra.
- term: Non-circularity audit (locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied)
  definition: >-
    For NarrativeTime, a partition of held-out edges into LOCALLY-JUSTIFIABLE (a textual cue near both events that the local-only
    reader can exploit) versus PURELY-TIMELINE-IMPLIED (no local cue; gold obtainable only from the human's holistic timeline).
    The deduction-required headline subset is the latter; because its gold is human-timeline placement (not algorithmic PC),
    recovering it by closure over independently LLM-read edges uses a DIFFERENT inference process and is non-circular. The
    fraction is reported up front.
- term: End-to-end hallucination-reduction headline (H2)
  definition: >-
    Promoted from a Tier-2 echo to a co-headline because it is the umbrella pipeline's actual deliverable: on the deduction-required
    / absent-relation subset, the closure pipeline's CONFIDENT-WRONG (non-abstained gold-mismatch) rate is lower than a raw
    LLM forced to a single relation, by at least a PRE-REGISTERED minimum effect, adjusted-CI-separated. A gateway test of
    the confirmatory family.
- term: Real-text iteration stratum (H3 on real text)
  definition: >-
    The dense corpus's >=3-edge/cyclic constraint structures, whose prevalence T0 computes a-priori (zero LLM spend). Length-2
    real queries still tie naive intersection (as predicted), but on this stratum full ITERATED closure can beat naive single-pass
    intersection -- bringing part of the iteration win onto real text instead of confining it to synthetic networks. If the
    stratum is empty/tiny, the iteration claim honestly stays synthetic-only.
- term: Applicability-envelope threshold (concrete number)
  definition: >-
    The pre-registered NUMBER distinguishing a 'general mechanism' from a 'niche safety-net': the deduction-required multi-path-with-bite
    fraction of evaluable held-out edges is scored >=10% = general mechanism, 5-10% = useful module, <5% = niche safety-net.
    Fixed before any LLM spend and reported from T0, so the contribution's reach is declared, not argued post-hoc.
- term: Multiplicity policy (confirmatory vs exploratory)
  definition: >-
    A pre-registered stance against the garden-of-forking-paths objection: the CONFIRMATORY family is H1 (narrowing), H2 (hallucination
    reduction), H3 (iteration gap grows), H4 (redundancy inverted-U disconfirmer), tested with Holm-Bonferroni / hierarchical
    gatekeeping (H1/H2 gateways) and ADJUSTED CIs; all strata, per-bin curves, reader-agnosticity, Mode-B, and secondary corpora
    are EXPLORATORY with nominal CIs.
- term: Recall-and-rho-matched reader-agnosticity
  definition: >-
    The protocol for the alternative-edge-reader test: each reader (METRE-style trained multi-label head; a second LLM/prompt
    family) is tuned to a MATCHED per-edge recall AND its measured cross-edge error correlation rho is reported, with the
    agnosticity verdict interpreted conditional on BOTH (conditioning on rho if it differs materially). Prevents 'the win
    is in the algebra' from being confounded by a reader whose F1-oriented training gives the same recall but different error
    correlation.
- term: Empirical joint soundness J(E)
  definition: >-
    The realized fraction of E-edge constraining subnetworks in which ALL edges are sound, MEASURED directly from data, replacing
    the independence product prod_e r_e. The zero-FP audit's reliability curve is pre-registered against J(E); the inverted-U
    cost term is 1 - J(E); positive cross-edge correlation rho makes J(E) decay slower than r^E so the predicted peak sits
    further out than an independence model says.
- term: Sound narrowing (Mode A, primary)
  definition: >-
    The zero-false-positive value mode: when every contributing LLM edge set is SOUND (contains its gold relation) but sub-universal,
    intersecting the compositions arriving at a query pair from MULTIPLE non-universal paths yields a set that still contains
    gold yet is strictly tighter than any single path. Requires breadth + multi-path bite, NOT over-commitment; its zero-FP
    guarantee SURVIVES PC incompleteness; inert only in the degenerate all-universal limit.
- term: Singleton-resolution-to-correct yield (headline metric)
  definition: >-
    The load-bearing Mode-A metric: the fraction of multi-path SOUND-input query pairs whose cross-path intersection collapses
    the query to the single CORRECT relation. Distinguished from STRICT-TIGHTENING yield (any reduction), which does NOT move
    matched-coverage selective accuracy nor the hallucination-rate metric. Both reported; singleton-resolution is load-bearing.
- term: Inverted-U redundancy optimum
  definition: >-
    Net Mode-A selective-accuracy gain RISES then FALLS as path redundancy/hop-count increases at fixed per-edge recall: more
    paths add narrowing benefit, but each added contributing edge lowers empirical joint soundness J(E), so silent-narrowing
    cost (1 - J(E)) eventually dominates. Peak location increases with recall; the recall-floor gate shifts it outward. Established
    only at a pre-registered estimation precision; otherwise reported as 'directionally consistent.'
- term: Naive-intersection baseline
  definition: >-
    Intersect the compositions arriving at the query pair in a SINGLE pass, without iterating to a fixpoint and without algebra-seeded
    converse propagation -- i.e. 'Path-of-Thoughts plus one obvious intersection step.' It COINCIDES with full closure on
    length-2 multi-path queries (so Mode A is predicted to TIE it on the real-text length-2 stratum) but diverges on longer/cyclic
    networks, where the full-minus-naive gap GROWS -- the iteration claim, tested on synthetic AND the real >=3-edge/cyclic
    stratum.
- term: Detection/repair (Mode B, secondary)
  definition: >-
    The collapse-based value mode: an empty closure certifies that some LLM edge is UNSOUND -- a gold-free zero-FP DETECTION
    flag (conditional on recall). Requires at least one over-committed/recall-failed edge to fire, supports Reiter-style minimal-hitting-set
    localisation/repair (which can mislocalise), and carries the silent-wrong-narrowing dual. Reported distinctly from Mode
    A; magnitude tracks the measured over-commitment rate.
- term: Recall-bite frontier
  definition: >-
    The curve, traced by sweeping the prompt-elicited breadth knob from 'name the relation' to 'name the maximal sound set,'
    of per-edge recall against singleton-resolution-to-correct yield and collapse rate. Recall and bite are in direct tension
    on the SAME knob, so a single operating point cannot establish viability; we map the frontier and pre-register that the
    main run proceeds only if a region clears a recall gate AND yields non-trivial singleton-resolution-to-correct.
- term: Deduction-required vs directly-readable stratification
  definition: >-
    A LOCAL-ONLY READER probe predicts each held-out edge from ONLY the minimal local span(s) where its two events co-occur
    (or flags 'no shared span'). Edges it confidently and correctly names are DIRECTLY-READABLE; the rest are DEDUCTION-REQUIRED
    (obtainable only by composing >=2 edges). We foreground the deduction-required fraction, stratify the headline by it,
    and draw the primary subset preferentially from deduction-required triangles. The T0 gate uses a structural proxy (no
    shared local span) computable without the LLM.
- term: Convex point algebra (NarrativeTime start-point arm)
  definition: >-
    The relation algebra over a single time point per event with convex base relations <=, =, >= (and disjunctions). NarrativeTime's
    timeline yields start-points whose ordering instantiates this algebra, for which path-consistency is provably COMPLETE
    and the table exact. We widen non-convex {<,>} (genuine !=) to VAGUE to preserve completeness and MEASURE the bite lost;
    if non-trivial we add a full-interval Allen arm scored as a lower-bound detector.
- term: Silent wrong narrowing (pre-registered failure mode)
  definition: >-
    When a contributing set OMITS gold (unsound), closure can narrow the query to a confident WRONG singleton with NO empty
    collapse -- a certified-LOOKING hallucination the mechanism actively endorses. Its rate is bounded per-edge by (1-recall)
    and per-network by (1 - J(E)); reported in the decomposition of gold-wrong non-abstained predictions; the recall-floor
    gate is tested as a mitigation and as the lever that shifts the inverted-U redundancy peak.
- term: Matched-coverage selective comparison
  definition: >-
    The protocol for comparing an abstaining method against baselines: each baseline is given its own abstention/confidence
    signal (vote margin, verbalised confidence, vote agreement, path-agreement), thresholds are swept so every method reports
    at the SAME coverage using the SAME coverage object (single-relation resolution), and selective accuracy is compared with
    paired-bootstrap CIs -- preventing the headline from conflating 'closure' with 'closure has a better-calibrated abstain.'
- term: Trace-graph
  definition: >-
    A human-auditable record: the QCN, which composition entries fired on which paths during closure, any minimal repairs,
    and optionally an equivalent SWI-Prolog/ASP proof discharged from the closed table for replay -- the connective tissue
    to the umbrella text-to-logic pipeline's auditability and quantified-hallucination-reduction requirements.
summary: >-
  We import exact relation-algebra path consistency (Allen interval, convex point algebra, RCC-8) into the deduction module
  of a text-to-logic pipeline and -- fixing the prior version's fatal corpus choice -- relocate the real-text headline from
  MATRES (adjacent-sentence-only, deduction-required envelope empty by construction) to a DENSE direct-human-gold corpus (NarrativeTime,
  full TLink coverage, human-timeline gold), corroborated on TDDMan whose gold is provably non-closure-derived: cross-path
  SOUND NARROWING of the LLM's high-recall disjunctive sets beats path-isolated reasoning and voting at matched coverage AND
  cuts the hallucination rate versus a raw LLM, while iterated closure beats naive single-pass intersection on long-hop/cyclic
  structures both synthetic AND real, and the recall-bounded inverted-U redundancy optimum is audited via empirical joint
  soundness J(E). An a-priori, zero-LLM-spend envelope gate (with a concrete applicability threshold), a confirmatory-vs-exploratory
  multiplicity policy, and recall-and-rho-matched reader-agnosticity make every headline falsifiable before any model is called.

title: 'Fold-split gold temporal relation graphs: NarrativeTime, TDDMan, MATRES'
summary: |-
  Frozen, reusable real-text gold temporal relation graphs that all downstream real-text closure experiments (the T0 envelope go/no-go pilot now; later arms) consume. Schema exp_sel_data_out, grouped by dataset, ONE example per (corpus, document) row (345 examples): input = the stripped document text (string), output = json.dumps(gold_graph) (string; parse with json.loads). The gold_graph has nodes [{node_id, node_type in {event,timex,dct}, surface, char_start, char_end, global_token_index, sentence_index, eiid/tid/eid, event_class, plus nt_event_type/nt_time/nt_branch/nt_start/nt_end for NarrativeTime}] and edges [{source, target, native_relation, canonical_algebra, canonical_relation_set, coarse_superset_set?, startpoint_relation_set, vague_widened, src/tgt_sentence_index, sentence_distance, locality_class in {intra,adjacent,long_distance}, structural_deduction_required_proxy (dist>=2), locally_justifiable_proxy (dist<=1), edge_fold, phenomena?}], plus per_doc_descriptive_counts. Each example also carries metadata_corpus/doc_id/fold/n_nodes/n_edges/n_events/long_distance_edges/descriptive_counts.

  Three corpora by role: (1) NarrativeTime (36 docs, 1,715 events, 103,748 edges, dense full TLink coverage, 1.58M event-event triangles) is the DENSE headline host; relations are produced by the corpus authors' OWN code (narrative_time.event_relations + conversion_utils), reproducing the shipped nt_converted_to_tml TLINKs EXACTLY (blocking gate: 207,496 relation-multisets + node counts match across all 36 docs) — non-circular gold; canonical_algebra=interval_allen with start-point point relations, non-convex {<,>} widened to {<,=,>} (vague_widened, 124 edges). (2) TDDMan (34 docs, 6,137 manually-annotated event-event pairs, 99.9% long-distance >=2 sentences apart) is the non-circularity anchor; codes {b,a,s,i,ii} mapped to tightest Allen + coarse superset + convex point sets; 107 test pairs carry TDDiscourse phenomena tags. (3) MATRES (275 docs, 6,099 events, 13,577 edges, 0% long-distance: 30% intra / 70% adjacent) is the gate-validation control with a near-empty deduction envelope; point algebra (BEFORE/AFTER/EQUAL/VAGUE -> {<}/{>}/{=}/{<,=,>}, no non-convex relations).

  Folds: document-level TimeBank-Dense 22/5/9 train/dev/test for NarrativeTime/TDDMan; MATRES train(TimeBank+AQUAINT)/test(Platinum); TDDMan edges also carry native edge_fold. One frozen NLTK Punkt sentence segmentation is reused across NarrativeTime/TDDMan; MATRES uses the canonical qiangning per-token sentence ids with SENTDIFF as authoritative distance. A doc-id overlap table (overlap_table.json) shows 33 documents shared by all three corpora. Aggregate + per-document DESCRIPTIVE structural counts (sizes, native/canonical label distributions, locality distribution, triangles, >=2-intermediate query edges, cyclomatic number, >=3-hop pairs) are in descriptive_counts.json. The gated statistics (deduction-required N*, bite-after-widening, singleton-resolution) are intentionally NOT computed here — they need composition closure / held-out-edge resolution and are the T0 experiment's job. Caveats: 1 TDDMan eid absent from the muk343 .tml version (APW19980213.1310/e257, 13 pairs dropped, reported in metadata.coverage_gaps); 238/6,099 MATRES events (3.9%) lack a char offset (boundary edge cases) but retain sentence_index + global_token_index; every non-null MATRES offset is surface-exact by construction; NarrativeTime gold uses annotator a1. Sources cited in README.md and metadata.sources (CogComp MATRES, qiangning EMNLP19 XML, TDDiscourse, text-machine-lab narrative_time, muk343 TimeBank-Dense, TempEval-3 TBAQ-cleaned). Reproduce via data.py / build_dataset.py with pinned pyproject.toml. An optional 4th TimeBank-Dense corpus builder is available (builders.build_timebank_dense) but not emitted.

  Synthetic QCN Backbone: consistent Allen/Point/RCC-8 networks with NL realizations
summary: |-
  Clean-ground-truth SYNTHETIC backbone for the redundancy (H4) and iteration (H3) claims: 35,100 globally-consistent Qualitative Constraint Networks over three relation algebras -- convex Point ('<','=','>') and Allen Interval (13 relations) as PRIMARY (500 networks/cell), RCC-8 (8 relations) as SECONDARY (300/cell). Every network is built by model-based realization (integer points / integer-grid intervals / collinear integer discs), so the gold ATOMIC relation on each edge is read exactly off the model and the whole scenario is globally consistent BY CONSTRUCTION (no solver needed). Composition + converse come from the authoritative alreich/qualreas tables, independently cross-checked by 436 tests (Allen composition matches exhaustive endpoint-CSP enumeration; RCC-8 reader sound vs disc enumeration; relation-algebra identity/converse axioms).

  Each network has a held-out query pair (s,t) that shares no edge and never co-occurs in one sentence -- DEDUCTION-REQUIRED: the query relation is obtainable only by composing >=1 multi-edge path. Topology is independently swept across 27 cells per algebra: redundancy P in {1,2,3,4,6,8}; hop L in {2,3,4,5}; cyclomatic mu in {0,1,2,3} via chord augmentation; small/medium/large node-count regimes; and random Renz-Nebel A(n,d) for the natural joint distribution. The intended structural signal is clean (results/dataset_metadata.json -> cell_summary): singleton-resolution rises monotonically with redundancy P (allen 0.40->0.89), bite decays with hop length, cyclomatic augmentation adds paths.

  Output is the aii exp_sel_data_out schema with 3 datasets (synthetic_qcn_point / synthetic_qcn_allen / synthetic_qcn_rcc8); ONE ROW = ONE network. input = template NL realization (one professional-prose sentence per non-query edge, 2-3 paraphrases per relation, + a final 'Query:' line); output = JSON string of the gold graph {edges:[{source,target,relation}], query_edge:{...,is_query:true}}. Rich metadata_* per row: fold (pilot/dev/test by md5(seed)%100 within each cell), algebra, cell labels, MEASURED structure (cyclomatic_number, cycle_basis_size, num_simple_paths_s_t, paths_truncated, contributing_edge_count, avg_degree), enumerated s-t paths with per-path gold composition + naive_intersection + has_bite + singleton_resolved, abstract_graph, entity_map, reference_disjunctive_labels (SOUND superset per edge; convex-only for point), model_embedding, seed. The CORRECTNESS GATE -- composition of gold atomic relations along every enumerated path CONTAINS the gold query relation -- passed on all 35,100 networks. Pre-registered realism thresholds (validated=false; TV<=0.15 / rho<=0.10 / EMD<=0.10) are recorded for next-iteration matching against the real-text frontier pilot.

  Files: full corpus split into full_data_out/full_data_out_1.json + full_data_out_2.json (each <100 MB; concatenate datasets with the same name across parts to reconstruct), plus mini_data_out.json (3 examples/algebra) and preview_data_out.json (10 examples/algebra, strings truncated). Generated deterministically by `uv run data.py` (~18 s on 4 cores; per (algebra, cell, index) md5 seeds, resumable). QA/provenance/dataset-card in results/dataset_metadata.json; algebra package + 436-check verification suite in qcn/ and tests/. The real-text corpora (NarrativeTime / TDDMan / MATRES) are delivered by SIBLING artifacts and are NOT duplicated here.

title: Zero-LLM T0 Envelope Gate + QCN Path-Consistency Engine over Temporal Corpora
summary: |-
  Implements and unit-validates a reusable Qualitative Constraint Network (QCN) path-consistency engine and runs the decisive zero-LLM-spend T0 envelope gate over three real temporal corpora, deciding whether (and where) a real-text headline is viable before iter-2 spends any LLM budget.

  ENGINE (engine.py): bitmask-encoded Algebra (Allen-13, convex Linear Point, RCC-8) loaded from authoritative qualreas tables (bundled in algebras/ for self-containment), a QCN, and THREE instrumented closure variants used as METHOD vs BASELINES in one pipeline: pc2_full = FULL iterated Mackworth PC-2 to fixpoint (OUR METHOD); naive_single_pass = single pass of length-2 intersections at the query edge (BASELINE, Path-of-Thoughts-style); closure_off = no propagation (lower baseline). Predictions appear per example as predict_our_method_full_pc / predict_baseline_naive_singlepass / predict_baseline_closure_off, with gold as output.

  ENGINE VALIDATION (tests.py, gates everything, ALL PASS): Allen 169-cell table validated against published Allen-1983 canonical cells + the composition-converse algebra law on all 169 cells + converse involution + identity; convex point COMPLETENESS confirmed vs brute-force enumeration (0 label/consistency mismatches over 200 random nets) => point arm is EXACT; A<B<C<A detected inconsistent; iteration isolation (FULL==NAIVE on a length-2 query, FULL!=NAIVE on a 3-hop chain).

  CORPORA (parsers.py, gold only, cached to cache/ for iter-2 reuse): MATRES (CogComp txt + qiangning EMNLP-19 sentence alignment) -> convex point on start-points; 100% of pairs are same/adjacent sentence (SENTDIFF in {0,1}). TDDMan (TDDiscourse tsv, strict Allen map + broad sensitivity) -> all pairs deduction-required by construction (non-circularity anchor). NarrativeTime (text-machine-lab annotator a1 timeline coords) -> dense full-coverage point gold + Allen interval arm.

  T0 FUNNEL + RESULTS (method.py -> method_out.json, exp_gen_sol_out schema-VALID): per held-out edge funnel evaluable -> (i) deduction-required -> (ii) multi-path -> (iii) bite-after-widening -> (iv) N* exact recovery, plus the >=3-edge/cyclic iteration envelope (full_only), widening bite-loss, paired-bootstrap power + faithful normal-approx MDE at true N, and the NarrativeTime locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied split. Findings: MATRES N*=0 (control; gate discriminative). TDDMan applicability 0.085 (module band; 0.104 broad), N*=408, full_only=12 -> genuine iterated-PC advantage on sparse manual long-distance gold; Allen recovery is a sound LOWER BOUND. NarrativeTime applicability 0.882 (general band), N*=25450 recovered EXACTLY, but full_only=0 because the dense timeline is near-transitively-closed so single-pass already has direct evidence (iteration ties single-pass on dense gold; 88.6% of edges purely-timeline-implied). Power: both real arms clear the pre-registered min effect 0.10 with power>=0.80 (NarrativeTime true-N MDE 0.05). A complete-graph fast path (full-PC == single-pass on complete graphs) was VERIFIED against genuine PC on 1095 cross-checks (0 mismatches), keeping runtime ~60s.

  VERDICT (hosting_decision.verdict_text): GO -> host the real-text headline on NarrativeTime; TDDMan is the non-circular corroboration arm; MATRES is the N*~0 control. This matches the pre-registered arm-scope: the certificate beats closure-off broadly, but iterated>single-pass only on SPARSE long-hop gold (TDDMan), not on dense timelines. Deliverables: engine.py, tests.py, parsers.py, method.py, bundled algebras/, reusable cache/, README.md, and full/mini/preview method_out JSON.

title: Synthetic QCN de-risking of iterated closure (H3) and redundancy inverted-U (H4)
summary: |-
  This experiment de-risks two mechanism claims for neuro-symbolic text->logic pipelines on clean synthetic ground truth, with ZERO LLM spend. It generates consistent-by-construction Qualitative Constraint Networks (QCNs) by realization off a sampled point assignment, and simulates the LLM reader as an exactly-controlled noisy channel with three knobs: per-edge recall r (P(gold in emitted set)), a sub-universal breadth distribution, and a within-network cross-edge soundness correlation rho (latent equicorrelated Gaussian). PRIMARY algebra = the convex point algebra ({<,=,>}; path-consistency provably COMPLETE), matching the NarrativeTime start-point arm; an optional Allen interval generality arm derives the 13x13 composition table from endpoint point-relations and self-verifies it.

  METHOD vs BASELINES run side-by-side in one pipeline: FULL iterated path-consistency closure (our method) vs NAIVE single-pass query-node intersection and OFF direct-read (baselines). Mode-A answers are singleton resolutions; each is classified CORRECT / WRONG (silent narrowing) / ABSTAIN / COLLAPSE (detected contradiction = the Mode-B certificate firing).

  RESULTS at the pre-registered full scale (N=600/cell, B_BOOT=2000, 378 cells, fully deterministic, ~60s on 4 cores) -- all three hypotheses PASS:
  - H3 (iteration > naive): FULL-minus-NAIVE selective-accuracy gap is 0.0 at hop-length L=2 (structural tie, CI includes 0) and grows monotonically to 0.99 at L=6 (3/3 ordered-trend tests: Page p~1e-13, Spearman bootstrap CI [0.9,1.0], hand-rolled Jonckheere p~0); the gap also rises with cyclomatic number (0.73->0.87 over 0..3 chords). Mechanism: longer/denser chains give iteration more tight-edge anchors that single-pass intersection cannot reach.
  - H4 (recall-dependent redundancy inverted-U): the Mode-A resolution rate P(CORRECT) is an inverted-U in redundancy K; the optimum K* moves OUTWARD with recall (peak K = 2,4,5,5,8 across r=0.5..0.95) and under the recall-floor gate; under positive rho the empirically MEASURED joint soundness J(E) exceeds the r^E independence model, pushing the optimum further out (low-recall benefit-centroid shift +0.95). Crucially the redundancy downside manifests as DETECTED collapse, not silent error.
  - C3 (zero false-positive certificate): among networks whose contributing edges are all sound, P(gold in Mode-A output) = 1.0 EXACTLY (soundness invariant of path-consistency); collapse never co-occurs with all-sound; overall silent-WRONG rate is only 5.8%; unsound networks decompose into 40% absorbed-correct / 38% detected-collapse / 11% abstain / 11% silent-wrong. The pre-registered contains-gold-vs-J(E) slope~1 is NOT met (slope 0.66) -- reported honestly -- because the convex algebra absorbs most single unsound reads, so retention OVER-delivers versus joint soundness (a stronger-than-predicted certificate).
  - Allen generality arm (exploratory): 13x13 table self-verified against canonical entries (o.o={p,m,o}, d.d={d}, p.P=universal, equals=identity); the resolution inverted-U and the zero-FP certificate both replicate; collapse rates are reported as a LOWER BOUND since PC is sound-but-incomplete for full Allen (the point arm stays exact).

  DELIVERABLES: method.py (full pipeline including Stage-0 algebra self-verify and Stage-1 hand-checked toy networks), allen_arm.py, method_out.json (exp_gen_sol_out-validated; metadata holds config/seeds/breadth, per-section H3/H4/C3/modeB/Allen results, a compact summary_for_paper block, and overall_verdict; the datasets array holds 240 worked QCN query examples each carrying predict_full/predict_naive/predict_off baseline columns and metadata_* fields), four PNG figures (H3 gap-vs-L tie+growth; H4 resolution inverted-U with outward-moving peaks + channel decomposition; J(E) vs r^E; zero-FP audit), and pyproject.toml pinning numpy==2.4.6/scipy==1.17.1/matplotlib==3.11.0. Downstream paper-writing can consume metadata.summary_for_paper and the figures directly; every PASS/FAIL boolean, located peak, trend p-value, and bootstrap CI is in metadata. Verdict: H3=PASS, H4=PASS, C3=PASS.

title: Recall-Bite Frontier & Go/No-Go Pilot for Closure-Certified Temporal Composition
summary: >-
  T0/pilot viability gate for the closure-certified temporal-composition study (does NOT run the main comparison). Self-contained
  pipeline: engine.py (POINT + Allen-13 qualitative algebras built programmatically by the endpoint method, cross-checked
  against the dossier's verified GQR composition cells; Mackworth PC-2 closure, length-2 triangle narrowing, naive-single-pass
  baseline, convex '!=' -> universal widening with counting), corpora.py (three real arms: TimeBank-Dense .tml TLINKs as the
  dense NarrativeTime stand-in [ALLEN]; TDDMan TSV joined to .tml text as the non-circular all-deduction-required arm [ALLEN];
  MATRES qiangning XML as the local gate control [POINT]), synth.py (scenario-then-abstract consistent QCNs as a clean-text
  reference), llm.py (async OpenRouter client with sha256 disk cache, hard cost-guard, robust JSON/relation parsing), method.py
  (orchestrator). Sweeps a 5-setting breadth knob (S1_single -> S5_maximal) via google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite (the dossier's
  gemini-2.5-flash-lite is delisted) at temperature 0, measuring per-edge recall (with doc-clustered bootstrap CIs), breadth,
  error-type mix, triangle collapse rate, strict-tightening, singleton-to-correct (overall + deduction-required subset, with
  CI), an explicit method(closure)-vs-baseline(direct read) delta, within-document error correlation rho (ICC), J(2)/J(3)
  vs a matched independence baseline, a local-only-reader probe, and point-vs-Allen bite-lost. RESULT: VERDICT=NO-GO/NICHE
  -- no real arm clears the pre-registered recall gate at any knob (TBDense 0.80, MATRES 0.86, TDDMan 0.58; gates 0.85 Allen
  / 0.90 point), so real-text READ SOUNDNESS, not the closure step, is the binding constraint; the synthetic clean-text arm
  reaches recall 0.96 with closure deduction-resolution ~0.37-0.42 (>=0.10), and closure ~= direct read on full-context deduction
  edges (delta~=0). Gate validation PASSED (MATRES deduction-fraction 0.0); rho=0.10 with J(E)>r^E; bite-lost=0; local-probe
  pins gold only 27% on deduction edges. Spend $0.58 over 4191 billed calls, 0 parse failures, 0 API errors. Output method_out.json
  validates against exp_gen_sol_out (840 per-edge examples with predict_<knob> fields + a 30-field metadata block: frontier_table,
  selected/fallback operating point, rho, J_E, deduction_required_fraction, gate_validation, method_vs_baseline_deduction,
  applicability_verdict, synthetic block, provenance, figures). For iter-2: headline the synthetic arm, scope real text as
  a niche safety-net, and measure closure's value against a LOCAL-only reader (not a full-context reader). Three figures:
  frontier scatter, breadth-vs-recall, collapse-vs-knob.

(2) TDDMan (34 docs, 6,137 manually-annotated event-event pairs, 99.9% long-distance >=2 sentences apart) is the non-circularity anchor; codes {b,a,s,i,ii} mapped to tightest Allen + coarse superset + convex point sets; 107 test pairs carry TDDiscourse phenomena tags. (3) MATRES (275 docs, 6,099 events, 13,577 edges, 0% long-distance: 30% intra / 70% adjacent) is the gate-validation control with a near-empty deduction envelope; point algebra (BEFORE/AFTER/EQUAL/VAGUE -> {<}/{>}/{=}/{<,=,>}, no non-convex relations).

  Folds: document-level TimeBank-Dense 22/5/9 train/dev/test for NarrativeTime/TDDMan; MATRES train(TimeBank+AQUAINT)/test(Platinum); TDDMan edges also carry native edge_fold. One frozen NLTK Punkt sentence segmentation is reused across NarrativeTime/TDDMan; MATRES uses the canonical qiangning per-token sentence ids with SENTDIFF as authoritative distance. A doc-id overlap table (overlap_table.json) shows 33 documents shared by all three corpora. Aggregate + per-document DESCRIPTIVE structural counts (sizes, native/canonical label distributions, locality distribution, triangles, >=2-intermediate query edges, cyclomatic number, >=3-hop pairs) are in descriptive_counts.json. The gated statistics (deduction-required N*, bite-after-widening, singleton-resolution) are intentionally NOT computed here — they need composition closure / held-out-edge resolution and are the T0 experiment's job. Caveats: 1 TDDMan eid absent from the muk343 .tml version (APW19980213.1310/e257, 13 pairs dropped, reported in metadata.coverage_gaps); 238/6,099 MATRES events (3.9%) lack a char offset (boundary edge cases) but retain sentence_index + global_token_index; every non-null MATRES offset is surface-exact by construction; NarrativeTime gold uses annotator a1. Sources cited in README.md and metadata.sources (CogComp MATRES, qiangning EMNLP19 XML, TDDiscourse, text-machine-lab narrative_time, muk343 TimeBank-Dense, TempEval-3 TBAQ-cleaned). Reproduce via data.py / build_dataset.py with pinned pyproject.toml. An optional 4th TimeBank-Dense corpus builder is available (builders.build_timebank_dense) but not emitted.

  Synthetic QCN Backbone: consistent Allen/Point/RCC-8 networks with NL realizations
summary: |-
  Clean-ground-truth SYNTHETIC backbone for the redundancy (H4) and iteration (H3) claims: 35,100 globally-consistent Qualitative Constraint Networks over three relation algebras -- convex Point ('<','=','>') and Allen Interval (13 relations) as PRIMARY (500 networks/cell), RCC-8 (8 relations) as SECONDARY (300/cell). Every network is built by model-based realization (integer points / integer-grid intervals / collinear integer discs), so the gold ATOMIC relation on each edge is read exactly off the model and the whole scenario is globally consistent BY CONSTRUCTION (no solver needed). Composition + converse come from the authoritative alreich/qualreas tables, independently cross-checked by 436 tests (Allen composition matches exhaustive endpoint-CSP enumeration; RCC-8 reader sound vs disc enumeration; relation-algebra identity/converse axioms).

  Each network has a held-out query pair (s,t) that shares no edge and never co-occurs in one sentence -- DEDUCTION-REQUIRED: the query relation is obtainable only by composing >=1 multi-edge path. Topology is independently swept across 27 cells per algebra: redundancy P in {1,2,3,4,6,8}; hop L in {2,3,4,5}; cyclomatic mu in {0,1,2,3} via chord augmentation; small/medium/large node-count regimes; and random Renz-Nebel A(n,d) for the natural joint distribution. The intended structural signal is clean (results/dataset_metadata.json -> cell_summary): singleton-resolution rises monotonically with redundancy P (allen 0.40->0.89), bite decays with hop length, cyclomatic augmentation adds paths.

  Output is the aii exp_sel_data_out schema with 3 datasets (synthetic_qcn_point / synthetic_qcn_allen / synthetic_qcn_rcc8); ONE ROW = ONE network. input = template NL realization (one professional-prose sentence per non-query edge, 2-3 paraphrases per relation, + a final 'Query:' line); output = JSON string of the gold graph {edges:[{source,target,relation}], query_edge:{...,is_query:true}}. Rich metadata_* per row: fold (pilot/dev/test by md5(seed)%100 within each cell), algebra, cell labels, MEASURED structure (cyclomatic_number, cycle_basis_size, num_simple_paths_s_t, paths_truncated, contributing_edge_count, avg_degree), enumerated s-t paths with per-path gold composition + naive_intersection + has_bite + singleton_resolved, abstract_graph, entity_map, reference_disjunctive_labels (SOUND superset per edge; convex-only for point), model_embedding, seed. The CORRECTNESS GATE -- composition of gold atomic relations along every enumerated path CONTAINS the gold query relation -- passed on all 35,100 networks. Pre-registered realism thresholds (validated=false; TV<=0.15 / rho<=0.10 / EMD<=0.10) are recorded for next-iteration matching against the real-text frontier pilot.

  Files: full corpus split into full_data_out/full_data_out_1.json + full_data_out_2.json (each <100 MB; concatenate datasets with the same name across parts to reconstruct), plus mini_data_out.json (3 examples/algebra) and preview_data_out.json (10 examples/algebra, strings truncated). Generated deterministically by `uv run data.py` (~18 s on 4 cores; per (algebra, cell, index) md5 seeds, resumable). QA/provenance/dataset-card in results/dataset_metadata.json; algebra package + 436-check verification suite in qcn/ and tests/. The real-text corpora (NarrativeTime / TDDMan / MATRES) are delivered by SIBLING artifacts and are NOT duplicated here.

title: Zero-LLM T0 Envelope Gate + QCN Path-Consistency Engine over Temporal Corpora
summary: |-
  Implements and unit-validates a reusable Qualitative Constraint Network (QCN) path-consistency engine and runs the decisive zero-LLM-spend T0 envelope gate over three real temporal corpora, deciding whether (and where) a real-text headline is viable before iter-2 spends any LLM budget.

  ENGINE (engine.py): bitmask-encoded Algebra (Allen-13, convex Linear Point, RCC-8) loaded from authoritative qualreas tables (bundled in algebras/ for self-containment), a QCN, and THREE instrumented closure variants used as METHOD vs BASELINES in one pipeline: pc2_full = FULL iterated Mackworth PC-2 to fixpoint (OUR METHOD); naive_single_pass = single pass of length-2 intersections at the query edge (BASELINE, Path-of-Thoughts-style); closure_off = no propagation (lower baseline). Predictions appear per example as predict_our_method_full_pc / predict_baseline_naive_singlepass / predict_baseline_closure_off, with gold as output.

  ENGINE VALIDATION (tests.py, gates everything, ALL PASS): Allen 169-cell table validated against published Allen-1983 canonical cells + the composition-converse algebra law on all 169 cells + converse involution + identity; convex point COMPLETENESS confirmed vs brute-force enumeration (0 label/consistency mismatches over 200 random nets) => point arm is EXACT; A<B<C<A detected inconsistent; iteration isolation (FULL==NAIVE on a length-2 query, FULL!=NAIVE on a 3-hop chain).

  CORPORA (parsers.py, gold only, cached to cache/ for iter-2 reuse): MATRES (CogComp txt + qiangning EMNLP-19 sentence alignment) -> convex point on start-points; 100% of pairs are same/adjacent sentence (SENTDIFF in {0,1}). TDDMan (TDDiscourse tsv, strict Allen map + broad sensitivity) -> all pairs deduction-required by construction (non-circularity anchor). NarrativeTime (text-machine-lab annotator a1 timeline coords) -> dense full-coverage point gold + Allen interval arm.

  T0 FUNNEL + RESULTS (method.py -> method_out.json, exp_gen_sol_out schema-VALID): per held-out edge funnel evaluable -> (i) deduction-required -> (ii) multi-path -> (iii) bite-after-widening -> (iv) N* exact recovery, plus the >=3-edge/cyclic iteration envelope (full_only), widening bite-loss, paired-bootstrap power + faithful normal-approx MDE at true N, and the NarrativeTime locally-justifiable vs purely-timeline-implied split. Findings: MATRES N*=0 (control; gate discriminative). TDDMan applicability 0.085 (module band; 0.104 broad), N*=408, full_only=12 -> genuine iterated-PC advantage on sparse manual long-distance gold; Allen recovery is a sound LOWER BOUND. NarrativeTime applicability 0.882 (general band), N*=25450 recovered EXACTLY, but full_only=0 because the dense timeline is near-transitively-closed so single-pass already has direct evidence (iteration ties single-pass on dense gold; 88.6% of edges purely-timeline-implied). Power: both real arms clear the pre-registered min effect 0.10 with power>=0.80 (NarrativeTime true-N MDE 0.05). A complete-graph fast path (full-PC == single-pass on complete graphs) was VERIFIED against genuine PC on 1095 cross-checks (0 mismatches), keeping runtime ~60s.

  VERDICT (hosting_decision.verdict_text): GO -> host the real-text headline on NarrativeTime; TDDMan is the non-circular corroboration arm; MATRES is the N*~0 control. This matches the pre-registered arm-scope: the certificate beats closure-off broadly, but iterated>single-pass only on SPARSE long-hop gold (TDDMan), not on dense timelines. Deliverables: engine.py, tests.py, parsers.py, method.py, bundled algebras/, reusable cache/, README.md, and full/mini/preview method_out JSON.

title: Synthetic QCN de-risking of iterated closure (H3) and redundancy inverted-U (H4)
summary: |-
  This experiment de-risks two mechanism claims for neuro-symbolic text->logic pipelines on clean synthetic ground truth, with ZERO LLM spend. It generates consistent-by-construction Qualitative Constraint Networks (QCNs) by realization off a sampled point assignment, and simulates the LLM reader as an exactly-controlled noisy channel with three knobs: per-edge recall r (P(gold in emitted set)), a sub-universal breadth distribution, and a within-network cross-edge soundness correlation rho (latent equicorrelated Gaussian). PRIMARY algebra = the convex point algebra ({<,=,>}; path-consistency provably COMPLETE), matching the NarrativeTime start-point arm; an optional Allen interval generality arm derives the 13x13 composition table from endpoint point-relations and self-verifies it.

  METHOD vs BASELINES run side-by-side in one pipeline: FULL iterated path-consistency closure (our method) vs NAIVE single-pass query-node intersection and OFF direct-read (baselines). Mode-A answers are singleton resolutions; each is classified CORRECT / WRONG (silent narrowing) / ABSTAIN / COLLAPSE (detected contradiction = the Mode-B certificate firing).

  RESULTS at the pre-registered full scale (N=600/cell, B_BOOT=2000, 378 cells, fully deterministic, ~60s on 4 cores) -- all three hypotheses PASS:
  - H3 (iteration > naive): FULL-minus-NAIVE selective-accuracy gap is 0.0 at hop-length L=2 (structural tie, CI includes 0) and grows monotonically to 0.99 at L=6 (3/3 ordered-trend tests: Page p~1e-13, Spearman bootstrap CI [0.9,1.0], hand-rolled Jonckheere p~0); the gap also rises with cyclomatic number (0.73->0.87 over 0..3 chords). Mechanism: longer/denser chains give iteration more tight-edge anchors that single-pass intersection cannot reach.
  - H4 (recall-dependent redundancy inverted-U): the Mode-A resolution rate P(CORRECT) is an inverted-U in redundancy K; the optimum K* moves OUTWARD with recall (peak K = 2,4,5,5,8 across r=0.5..0.95) and under the recall-floor gate; under positive rho the empirically MEASURED joint soundness J(E) exceeds the r^E independence model, pushing the optimum further out (low-recall benefit-centroid shift +0.95). Crucially the redundancy downside manifests as DETECTED collapse, not silent error.
  - C3 (zero false-positive certificate): among networks whose contributing edges are all sound, P(gold in Mode-A output) = 1.0 EXACTLY (soundness invariant of path-consistency); collapse never co-occurs with all-sound; overall silent-WRONG rate is only 5.8%; unsound networks decompose into 40% absorbed-correct / 38% detected-collapse / 11% abstain / 11% silent-wrong. The pre-registered contains-gold-vs-J(E) slope~1 is NOT met (slope 0.66) -- reported honestly -- because the convex algebra absorbs most single unsound reads, so retention OVER-delivers versus joint soundness (a stronger-than-predicted certificate).
  - Allen generality arm (exploratory): 13x13 table self-verified against canonical entries (o.o={p,m,o}, d.d={d}, p.P=universal, equals=identity); the resolution inverted-U and the zero-FP certificate both replicate; collapse rates are reported as a LOWER BOUND since PC is sound-but-incomplete for full Allen (the point arm stays exact).

  DELIVERABLES: method.py (full pipeline including Stage-0 algebra self-verify and Stage-1 hand-checked toy networks), allen_arm.py, method_out.json (exp_gen_sol_out-validated; metadata holds config/seeds/breadth, per-section H3/H4/C3/modeB/Allen results, a compact summary_for_paper block, and overall_verdict; the datasets array holds 240 worked QCN query examples each carrying predict_full/predict_naive/predict_off baseline columns and metadata_* fields), four PNG figures (H3 gap-vs-L tie+growth; H4 resolution inverted-U with outward-moving peaks + channel decomposition; J(E) vs r^E; zero-FP audit), and pyproject.toml pinning numpy==2.4.6/scipy==1.17.1/matplotlib==3.11.0. Downstream paper-writing can consume metadata.summary_for_paper and the figures directly; every PASS/FAIL boolean, located peak, trend p-value, and bootstrap CI is in metadata. Verdict: H3=PASS, H4=PASS, C3=PASS.

title: Recall-Bite Frontier & Go/No-Go Pilot for Closure-Certified Temporal Composition
summary: >-
  T0/pilot viability gate for the closure-certified temporal-composition study (does NOT run the main comparison). Self-contained
  pipeline: engine.py (POINT + Allen-13 qualitative algebras built programmatically by the endpoint method, cross-checked
  against the dossier's verified GQR composition cells; Mackworth PC-2 closure, length-2 triangle narrowing, naive-single-pass
  baseline, convex '!=' -> universal widening with counting), corpora.py (three real arms: TimeBank-Dense .tml TLINKs as the
  dense NarrativeTime stand-in [ALLEN]; TDDMan TSV joined to .tml text as the non-circular all-deduction-required arm [ALLEN];
  MATRES qiangning XML as the local gate control [POINT]), synth.py (scenario-then-abstract consistent QCNs as a clean-text
  reference), llm.py (async OpenRouter client with sha256 disk cache, hard cost-guard, robust JSON/relation parsing), method.py
  (orchestrator). Sweeps a 5-setting breadth knob (S1_single -> S5_maximal) via google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite (the dossier's
  gemini-2.5-flash-lite is delisted) at temperature 0, measuring per-edge recall (with doc-clustered bootstrap CIs), breadth,
  error-type mix, triangle collapse rate, strict-tightening, singleton-to-correct (overall + deduction-required subset, with
  CI), an explicit method(closure)-vs-baseline(direct read) delta, within-document error correlation rho (ICC), J(2)/J(3)
  vs a matched independence baseline, a local-only-reader probe, and point-vs-Allen bite-lost. RESULT: VERDICT=NO-GO/NICHE
  -- no real arm clears the pre-registered recall gate at any knob (TBDense 0.80, MATRES 0.86, TDDMan 0.58; gates 0.85 Allen
  / 0.90 point), so real-text READ SOUNDNESS, not the closure step, is the binding constraint; the synthetic clean-text arm
  reaches recall 0.96 with closure deduction-resolution ~0.37-0.42 (>=0.10), and closure ~= direct read on full-context deduction
  edges (delta~=0). Gate validation PASSED (MATRES deduction-fraction 0.0); rho=0.10 with J(E)>r^E; bite-lost=0; local-probe
  pins gold only 27% on deduction edges. Spend $0.58 over 4191 billed calls, 0 parse failures, 0 API errors. Output method_out.json
  validates against exp_gen_sol_out (840 per-edge examples with predict_<knob> fields + a 30-field metadata block: frontier_table,
  selected/fallback operating point, rho, J_E, deduction_required_fraction, gate_validation, method_vs_baseline_deduction,
  applicability_verdict, synthetic block, provenance, figures). For iter-2: headline the synthetic arm, scope real text as
  a niche safety-net, and measure closure's value against a LOCAL-only reader (not a full-context reader). Three figures:
  frontier scatter, breadth-vs-recall, collapse-vs-knob.

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: latency (seconds, 0-5). Values: PostgreSQL=4.6s (red), Bao=2.8s (blue), RLQOpt=2.0s (green). Error bars +/-0.3-0.8. Sans-serif font, white background.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero):

Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-06-17 14:47:08 UTC

```
### Goal

Develop an operational translation pipeline that converts unstructured textual content (e.g., short legal documents, news articles, kids' stories) into a formal first-order logic representation. The output must be capable of (probabilistic) reasoning using a logic reasoner (like Prolog), leveraging LLMs to dynamically resolve terminology, concepts, and relations that are not well defined in the explicit text.

### Reviewer Scope

Limit the technical core to areas the reviewer can deeply evaluate. Other fields are welcome for inspiration but should not host the substantive contribution.

Reviewer-evaluable areas: semantic technologies, logic programming, inductive logic programming, information retrieval, machine learning, LLMs, deep learning, knowledge extraction, knowledge graphs, reasoning, and text data analytics.

The pipeline should ingest a short document (approx. 3000 characters) and parse it into a structured, computable format. Methods may combine an LLM acting as a semantic translation engine (mapping natural text to first-order logic or Prolog predicates), a running logic interpreter (like SWI-Prolog) for symbolic execution, and the integration of upper ontologies like OpenCyc to supply necessary background structure and taxonomic grounding. Furthermore, an LLM should be deployed as a probabilistic reasoning engine to handle fuzzy unifications, semantic similarities, and logical gaps where strict symbolic matching fails due to language ambiguity.

Evaluation must be rigorous and compare the neuro-symbolic pipeline against purely neural baselines (e.g., standard RAG, chain-of-thought prompting) on standard logical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., RuleTaker, CLUTRR) or custom annotated datasets. It must specifically measure:
(i) the precision and recall of atomic fact extraction directly from the original document, and
(ii) the accuracy of multi-hop fact extraction and logical deductions that require synthesizing explicit document facts with implicit common-sense knowledge.

Outputs must provide human-auditable trace-graphs of the reasoning steps to clearly demonstrate the logical path taken.

Constraints: The pipeline must be highly reproducible on any short, professionally written documents. Inference must be executable on commodity hardware, and the system must report a quantified reduction in hallucination rates compared to raw LLM generation.

### Publication

Target ACL Knowledge Extraction track as the primary venue, with EMNLP or specialized neuro-symbolic AI conference tracks (e.g., NeSy) as fallback targets.

### Things to Avoid

Avoid simplistic propositional logic translations of the text. Avoid purely neural black-box systems that lack interpretable reasoning traces. The substantive contribution must be an operational, hybrid method for reasoning with textual content that explicitly minimizes hallucinations.

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in one batch
3. Write the returned .bib text into `./references.bib`

Rules:
- Do NOT fabricate BibTeX entries — always fetch from Semantic Scholar
- If a paper isn't found (very recent preprint), write the entry manually as fallback
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."

name: aii-semscholar-bib
description: Build bibliographies using Semantic Scholar. Batch-fetch BibTeX for papers by DOI, ArXiv ID, or title. Use when writing papers, generating reference lists, or building .bib files.
---

## Tool: `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch`

Batch-fetch BibTeX entries from Semantic Scholar. Pass all references in a single call — the tool handles batching internally.

### How it works

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Post-process** → fix entry type, fix citation key (AuthorYYYY), inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": ""}],
  "failed": []
}
```

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in **one call**
3. Save `bib_text` from the response to your `references.bib` file
4. Check `failed` — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract title, authors, year, venue, DOI/ArXiv ID
3. If DOI/ArXiv found → retry `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with it
4. Last resort: write BibTeX by hand using **only verified info from the actual paper page**

### CLI (for manual use / debugging)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-semscholar-bib" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_semscholar_bib__fetch.py --refs '[
  {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
  {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
  {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
]'
```

`--json, -j` — output raw JSON instead of .bib text

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
